#### Robert Boyle
In 1667, almost two decades prior to the popularization of salvage diving,
an Irish physicist named Robert Boyle built a small low-pressure chamber
and conducted a series of experiments relating to pressure and volume.
Some of Boyle’s experiments subjected animals to reduced ambient
pressure. In one such experiment, Boyle observed a snake’s extreme
discomfort and noticed a bubble that had formed in one of the snake’s
eyes. Boyle recorded this phenomenon but at the time had no explanation
as to the bubble’s origin. This appears to be the earliest discovery of
decompression illness.

#### Paul Bert
Paul Bert studied and taught physiology in France throughout the 1860s
and 1870s. Through research and experimentation, Bert concluded that
altering ambient pressures resulted in corresponding changes to the gases
in tissues. He noticed that too much oxygen in the blood was toxic and that
too little caused oxygen deprivation.
Bert discovered two things: that decreasing ambient pressure caused
bubbles to form in tissues, which in turn caused the bends; and that
the bubbles consisted of nitrogen gas. He observed that long exposures
with rapid depressurization caused terrible side effects while minimal
exposures with slow depressurization caused little to no ill effects.
Bert was the first to recommend deep stops, specifically stopping
halfway between maximum depth and the surface. He also observed
the advantages of recompression therapy as well as the effectiveness of
breathing pure oxygen once bent. Bert was so influential that to this day
CNS oxygen toxicity is known as the “Paul Bert Effect.”****

#### Haldane John Scott
In 1905, Scottish physiologist John Scott Haldane began working with the
Royal Navy’s Deep Diving Committee in an effort to decrease instances of
the bends. Through experimentation on goats, Haldane concluded that each
tissue in the body absorbs and releases gases at different rates. He introduced
the concept of “tissue compartments” and suggested unique half times for
each. Haldane also set over-pressurization limits for the tissue compartments.
Five tissue groups were identified with 5, 10, 20, 40, and 75 minute half
times.

In 1908, Haldane became the first person to
create and publish dive tables based on a
scientifically predicted decompression model.
The tables were printed in the Journal of
Hygiene. Haldane’s conclusions were adopted
worldwide and his methods set the foundation
for most modern decompression models.


### Richard Pyle
As divers began pushing deeper, staying longer, and using various mixed
gasses, the need for further model adjustments became apparent. Most of
these adjustments came in the form of deeper initial stops. One of the most
popular tweaks to the Neo-Haldanian models was introduced by Richard L.
Pyle.
Pyle is a self-proclaimed “fish-nerd”, not a decompression physiologist
and as such, he based his adjustments on practical observations rather than
scientific modeling. The following excerpt from The Importance of Deep
Safety Stops: Rethinking Ascent Patterns from Decompression Dives, by
Richard L. Pyle sheds some light on the rationale behind the development
of what many divers now call “Pyle stops.”

*Back before the concept of “technical diving” existed, I used to do*
*more dives to depths of 180-220 feet than I care to remember. Because*
*of the tremendous sample size of dives, I eventually began to notice a*
*few patterns. Quite frequently after these dives, I would feel some level*
*of fatigue or malaise. It was clear that these post-dive symptoms had*
*more to do with inert-gas loading than with physical exertion or thermal*
*exposure, because the symptoms would generally be much more severe*
*after spending less than an hour in the water for a 200-foot dive than they*
*would after spending 4 to 6 hours at much shallower depths.*

Pyle’s method for incorporating deep stops was as follows:
1) Calculate a decompression profile for the dive you wish to do, using
whatever software you normally use.
2) Take the distance between the bottom portion of the dive (at the time
you begin your ascent) and the first “required” decompression stop, and
find the midpoint. You can use the ambient pressure midpoint if you want,
but for most dives in the “technical” diving range, the linear distance
midpoint will be close enough and is easier to calculate. This depth will
be your first deep safety stop, and the stop should be about 2-3 minutes in
duration.
3) Re-calculate the decompression profile by including the deep safety stop
in the profile (most software will allow for multi-level profile calculations).
4) If the distance between your first deep safety stop and your first
“required” stop is greater than 9 m / 30 ft, then add a second deep safety
stop at the midpoint between the first deep safety stop and the first required
stop.
5) Repeat as necessary until there is less than 9 m / 30 ft between your last
deep safety stop and the first required safety stop.
