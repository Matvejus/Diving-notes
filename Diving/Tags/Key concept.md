/**A diver suffering from pulmonary effects of oxygen will have some difficulty breathing, pain of inhalation, dry unproductive cough, and soreness in the lungs/or throat.** 

**/Oxygen is is thought to carry with it narcosis properties as well, perhaps even slightly greater than that of nitrogen. Rule of thumb is to not dive nitrox deeper than you you would dive with air.**


There is some evidence that part of the reason decompression illness issues are so complicated is because the body reacts to the disorder as if the body is being attacked more so than when if has sustained injury. This is in part why it is now reffered to as an illness. This creates immune cascade that can occur throughout the body, not just at the point where the bubbles have occurred. Thus, the presence of even a small number of bubbles can create an even larger whole body reaction

**Saturation takes place when the partial**
**pressures of the inspired gases match the partial**
**pressures of the dissolved gases in the blood**
**and tissues. The longer divers stay submerged,**
**the closer they will come to a state of saturation.

**Certain areas of the body such as the elbows,**
**shoulders, and spine are more susceptible to**
**the formation of gas micronuclei. Movable**
**joints mechanically create areas of supersaturation,**
**forming gas micronuclei in nearly**
**every joint in our body.**

**Over the years, Doppler testing has**
**shown that bubbles are present in most**
**divers even when following extremely**
**conservative schedules.**
