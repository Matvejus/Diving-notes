## Technical diving fundamentals - Chapter 2
1. An elite diver will have a focus on their dive that is:
	Mission oriented approach and technical approach. Diving is means to an end to access something distinct and special underwater. Focus on a dive and 360 control all the time.
2. The elite diver will focus on what fundamentals of diving?
	1. Buoyancy
	2. Swimming
	3. Trim
	4. Breathing
3. How can lung volume be used to control buoyancy?
	1. Inhale go up, exhale go down
4. While using Ideal breathing the dive should fill their lungs from the bottom and empty them from the top
5. 2 reasons to deviate from the ideal breathing:
	1. On purpose, consciously
	2. On rebreather
6. While diving, when should be hand be used for positioning and turning? - Never
7. What are the advantage of diving in working position? - streamlined, less effort, no dangling equipment that can snatch.
8. What body position should a diver be in during the working portion of a dive near an impactable environment? - flat, arched back, knees bent.
9. Is there a time in diving when the foundational skills can be ignored? - no


## Chapter 3

1. Oxygen is odorless and tasteless gas
2. Oxygen is necessary for life
3. Boyles law calculation:
	1. Gas pressure at depth
	2. Gas consumption
4. Dalton law calculations:
	1. Gas partial pressure at depth
	2. MOD
	3. Best mix
5. EAD is a way to use standard dive tables when Using nitrox. If we take a EANx at a ceratain depth it would equal breathing regular air at a lower depth. If we breathe Nitrox at 27, it would equal breathing air at 21m (made up numbers).


## Chapter 4

1. Hypoxia is breathing a mix with less of 21% oxygen, which could lead to fatal outcome.
2. Any mixture with less than 0.21 precent oxygen is considered to be hypoxic mixture
3. The risk of hypoxia is higher with CCR is due to the possible cases where the system/diver does not correctly monitor the levels of O2, and doesn't add enough.
4. A mixture of gas with no oxygen is **Anoxic**
5. If a diver is exposed to more than 1 ata of oxygen during the dive, than this exposure must be tracked
6. Signs of CNS toxicity (high volume, short time) are characterized by CONVENTID
	1. CON - convulsion
	2. V - visual disturbances
	3. E - Ear ringing
	4. N - Nausea
	5. T - trembling/tremors
	6. I - irritability
	7. D - dizziness
7. Percentage of oxygen exposure for a 55 minute dive with PO2 1.2 ata: 
	1. 1.2 ATA = 210 minutes max
	2. 55 / 210 x 100 = 26.19%
	
8. Signs of pulmonary toxicity: painful breathing, dry cough
9. OTU after 55 minute dive with 1.5 ata
	1. 1.2 ata = 1.323 OTU per minute
	2. 1.323 x 55 = 72.77 OTU
10. Allowed OTU for 5 day diving: daily allowable OTU 300, so no more than 300 per day?????
11. to make better ascents diver can: deploy a dsmb to use it as ascent line, use a static reference points in the water/ particles in the water, 
12. Symptoms of nitrogen narcosis: light headed (drunk feeling), disorientation, task fixation
13. describe how to minimize carbon dioxide while diving: deep breaths, from the bottom of the belly and slow release from the top. No short breathing.
14. Most common source of carbon monoxide is the exhaust from the boat, or any other kind of fumes that can be absorbed by the filling compressor
15. The body's immune system will react to a dci/dcs like to a virus and will start attacking the area where the injure occurred

## Chapter 5 - formula work
1. pressure difference between 30m and surface is 4ata
2. best mix for diving to 32m
	1. best mix PO2 = 1.4 ata
	2. best mix formula:   1.4 / 4.2 = 0.33 = 33% oxygen mix
3. EAN 27 MOD: 1.4 / 0.27 = 5.18 ata  = 41.2 Meters
4. PO2 at 30m for EAN30: 4ata x .30 = 1.2ata
5. EAD of EAN 36 at 25M
	1. EAD Formula (((PN in mix) x (depth + 10)) / PN in air) - 10
	2. (((0.64) * (25+10))/ 0.79) - 10 = 18.35M


## Chapter 6 - equipment

1. Equipment that is used with oxygen percentages greater than 40% must be cleaned for oxygen service
2. 3 steps in the oxygen cleaning process:
	1. prepare the equipment for cleaning
	2. get rid of hydrocarbons in the equipment
	3. replace parts for oxygen compatible
3. If the oxygen serviced equipment was contaminated, it should go through the oxygen cleaning process once again.

### Chapter 7 - Making nitrox work
1. 3 tools for dive planning:
	1. Tables
	2. Programmable computers
	3. Personal dive computers
2. 3 limitations of using dive computers
	1. The dive profile should be dived according to a plan, computer may show it's own dive profile.
	2. Computer may fail underwater
	3. Computer generated dive plans do not allow any kind of modification
3. 3 benefits of using a dive computer:
	1. Allow detailed planning
	2. Personal dive computers allow the modification of dive plan in real time in case if the original plan wasn't followed
	3. Allow to create plans with different levels of conservatism
4. The best way to back up a dive computer is to have a similar computer that uses the same decompression algorithm

## Chapter 8 - Dive planning
1. Benefit of hand calculating dive planning: allows to understand where the run and stop times come from, how different decisions affect the dive plan. Know the dive plan by hearth.
2. 5 aspects of dive planning and importance of each:
	1. Planning software - allows to create dive plans faster, important to enter all of the correct gases, depth and desired bottom time.
	2. Gas planning - calculate the amount of gas that will be used during the dive and plan bottom time accordingly
	3. Oxygen planning - Calculate the CNS exposure and OTUs for the dive and stay within limits
	4. Nitrogen limitations - the goal is to extend the bottom time at the desired depth of the dive and select the best mix.
	5. Thermal considerations - tec dives are usually longer and deeper, diver must think of a thermal protection to use during the dive,  5/7mm wetsuit or drysuit to stay warm but not experience thermal stress.
3. Calculating gas needs is very important, bottom time will depend from the RMV/SAC rate, as well as planning the reserves and turn pressures.
4. 12 bars diving at 10 meters for 10 minutes, 11l cylinder. What is the RMV?:
	1. gas used  = 12 x 11 = 132L
	2. RMV = 132/10min/2ata = 6.6l/min
5. RMV 13L, depth 25m, time 35min. Total gas needed to conduct bottom part of the dive
	1. Gas needed at the bottom  = 13 x 3.5ata x 35 min = 1592.5L
6. Multilevel dive plan. 28m for 30 min, RMV 5L/min, tropical water
	1. Best mix = 1.4/3.8 = EAN 36
	2. EAN 36 OTU = 1.631 x 30 = 49 OTU
	3. CNS exposure = 30min /150 min  x 100 = 20% CNS exposure
	4. EAD  = (((0.64) * (28+10))/ 0.79) - 10 = 20.78m (max time 37 min, N group O after 30 min dive)
	5. Gas needed = 5x3.8x30 = 570L (48 bar from 12L tank)
	6. Single 12L aluminium tank, EAN 36, 5mm wetsuit

## Chapter 9 - Dive protocols

1. Benefit of pre-dive checklist: check the readiness for the dive step by step and confirm with dive buddy
2. Before breathing any gas mixture:
	1. Analyze the mix yourself
	2. Log the breathing gas
	3. Mark the gas on a visible place on the tank
3. START check:
	1. S-Drill - Out of air situation and bubble check
	2. T - team equipment check
	3. Air - confirm the air you are about to breath
	4. R - planned entry and exit 
	5. T - tables, time, schedule
4. Descent: Controlled descent with buddy being always visible and checked to examine the equipment and give a final decision.
5. Ascent: Slow and controlled, control the ascent speed at all times to allow deco stops.
6. Stops for multilevel dive to 30M: Deep stop for a 2-3 minutes at 12.5m and stop at 5m for 3 minutes?
7. Bailout planning: for OC - turn pressures and reserves when planning a dive to account for a safety stop at 5 meters, for CCR - best mix, mod and amount of needed air to get to the surface from the deepest part of the dive

## Chapter 10 - Gas mixing 

1. Partial pressure mixing - tank is filled with a desired partial pressure of oxygen then nitrogen is added
2. Continuous blending - mixes oxgyen from o2 tanks with air tanks to get a desired mix
3. Membrane system - the easiest in terms of labor process. A select a memebrane that would pass through the desired amount of oxygen and remove the nitrogen in to the tank
