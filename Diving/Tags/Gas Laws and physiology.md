1. Boyles law concerns itself with the relationship between pressure and volume when temperature is constant. The law describes the inverse relation between volume and pressure. During decent, the deeper you go volume gets smaller. Allows to calculate the gas pressure at any depth, the amount of gas the will be consumed at that depth and how much volume will increase if they ascend from one depth to another.
2. Dalton's law reflects the pressure of a gas in a gas mixture. Each gas in mixture will have a pressure that is directly related to its fraction in the mixture. Partial pressure of a gas is equal to its fraction of the total pressure of the gas. Allows to calculate maximum operating depth, best mix and partial pressure calculations. Also used for gas blending calculation.

## Hypoxia
Too little oxygen is know as hypoxia. Breathing a mixture of gas with O2 less than 21% is breathing hypoxic mixture. Partial pressure of oxygen below .16 ATA are hazardous. Levels below 0.12 ATA can prove fatal in just a short period of time

## Oxygen toxicity
If the diver breathes a partial pressure of oxygen above 0.5 ATA the diver must track oxygen exposure for each dive and for multiple dives throughout consecutive days. Oxygen toxicity falls into two areas.
1. Short-term high dose exposures affect the divers risk of having the most dramatic problem with diving mixed gasses known as Central Nervous System Toxicity, tracked as a percentage of the allowed dose for each dive and the total of each day of diving
2. Long term lower dose related problems. The diver tracks this exposure with assistance of Oxygen Tolerance Units, OTUs. These are used to track whole body/pulmonary exposures.

### CNS Oxygen Toxicity
Con = Convulsion
V = Visual Disturbances
E = Ear Ringing
N = Nausea
T = Twitching/Tingling inf the face or fingers
I = Irritability
D = Dizziness
