4. The term “Caisson’s Disease” was used to describe: DCS, Bends

5. Paul Bert discovered two things: that **Decreasing** ____________ ambient

the bends; and that the bubbles consisted of **Nitrogen**____________ gas.

6. In 1908, Haldane became the first person to create and publish
dive tables based on a scientifically predicted decompression model: **True**

7. In 1924 the first **US Navy** Diving Manual was published
incorporating many of the practices and procedures developed by
George Stillson’s program.

## Chapter 3

1. While scuba diving, most gas molecules enter and
exit the body through: the alveoli
2. Both perfusion and diffusion control(s) the amount of gas that a tissue
will absorb in a given amount of time.

>*The walls of the alveoli and the capillaries are each only one cell thick,*
>*allowing gas molecules to move easily from one to the other in a process*
>*known as diffusion. Diffusion is a movement of molecules from an area of*
>*high concentration to an area of low concentration.* 
>
>*Henry’s law states that at a constant temperature, the amount of a given gas dissolved in a given type and volume of liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in equilibrium with that liquid.*
>*In addition to diffusion, perfusion also controls the amount of gas that a*
>*tissue will absorb in a given amount of time. Perfusion is the amount of*
>*blood flow a tissue receives. Tissues that receive a higher blood flow will*
>*on and off-gas quickly and are known as ‘fast tissues.’ Tissues that receive*
>*a lower blood flow will on and off-gas slowly. These are known as ‘slow*
>*tissues.’ The tissue compartment half times mentioned earlier in this book*
>*are influenced by the rate of perfusion.*

3. During ascent, it is probable that fast tissues will be supersaturated
and will be **Off-gassing** while slow tissues will be
under-saturated and will be **On-gassing**.

4. The presence of gas micronuclei increases the likelihood of
bubble formation. - True

>*Gas micronuclei occur at points in the body called nucleation sites where*
>*inert gas concentrations are altered due to the turbulence of flowing blood and the movement of tissues. This weakens the bonds of the containing fluids or tissues and plants the seed for bubble formation and growth.*
>*Certain areas of the body such as the elbows, shoulders, and spine are more susceptible to the formation of gas micronuclei. Movable joints mechanically create areas of supersaturation, forming gas micronuclei in nearly every joint in our body.*

5. By conducting decompression stops, the diver is attempting to
control the over-pressurization ratio; thereby: **Minimizing bubble formation and the risks associated with decompression sickness.**

6. The human body’s reaction to bubbles in the blood is quite
similar to its reaction to other foreign substances such as
bacteria and viruses: **True**

7. Because dive tables, computers, and desktop software are based
on mathematical formulas that perfectly model gas behavior in
the human body, it is extremely unlikely that bubbles will develop
when these tools are used properly: **False**

8. Excessive **Silent Bubbles** in the body after a dive may
increase post dive fatigue and create problems on repetitive dives.

>*Though a certain number of silent bubbles are common after a dive, an excess may result in an accumulation in the capillaries surrounding the alveoli and can reduce the amount of gas exchange taking place; thus decreasing the body’s ability to expel inert gas and absorb oxygen. This, combined with some level of immune system reaction, may increase post dive fatigue and create problems on repetitive dives.*

9. The initial symptoms of decompression sickness are a direct
result of the pressure exerted by the growing inert gas bubbles on
the surrounding tissues and nerves: **True**

15. Smoking cigarettes bla-bla-bla: **True**
16. Divers should not keep physically fit by eating well and
exercising regularly: **False**
17. Evidence suggests that strenuous exercise immediately before a
dive leads to an increase in the formation of gas micronuclei and is
therefore not recommended: **True**

18. Emerging evidence leads us to believe that the presence of a Patent
Foramen Ovale (PFO) may be a leading cause of “undeserved hits.”: **True**

>*When a baby is born, the umbilical cord is severed and the baby begins*
*breathing on its own. The heart must now route the blood through the*
*lungs in order for gas exchange to take place. In most humans, the foramen*
*ovale seals shut after birth; however, when the hole does not close properly, it is called a patent foramen ovale or PFO. Because the pressure in the heart’s left atrium is greater than the pressure in the right, the PFO typically remains closed and does not allow blood to travel through it. Sometimes when the body is strained, the pressures can change. This pressure change may open the tissue flap and allow blood to pass from the right atrium to the left. This blood has now bypassed the lungs and will be pumped back through the body.*

19. If temperature fluctuations cannot be avoided, it is generally
better to be warmer during the bottom phase of a dive and cooler
during the decompression phase: **False**

20. The Divers Alert Network (DAN) recommends a minimum preflight
surface interval of 12 hours for a single no-decompression dive,
a minimum interval of 18 hours for multiple dives per day or multiple
days of diving, and a surface interval substantially longer than 18
hours is recommended for dives requiring decompression stops: **True**

21. The majority of DCI incidents require treatment at a: **recompression chamber**
22. The best way to avoid narcosis is to avoid deep diving or choose
a breathing medium appropriate for the planned depth: **True**

23. A diver’s tissues require a sustained minimum oxygen
partial pressure of **0.16** ATA (minimum of **0.18** ATA recommended) in order to function properly.

24. Central nervous system toxicity is generally caused by long term
exposures to low oxygen partial pressures: **False**

25. At rest, exposure to a maximum PO2 of **1.6** ATA is
generally deemed acceptable and during periods of elevated
activity, this limit is reduced to **1.4** ATA.

26. Pulmonary toxicity is characterized by irritation and
inflammation of the airways leading to the lungs and of the lungs
themselves. This type of toxicity is caused by long exposures to
relatively low oxygen partial pressures: **True**

27. Increased partial pressure of CO2 is believed to be a
contributing factor to the onset of: **narcosis, oxygen
toxicity, and decompression sickness.**

28. Signs and symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include: 
	• Nausea
	• Dizziness
	• Headache
	• Fatigue
	• Confusion
	• Unconsciousness
	• Chest Pain
	• Irritability
	• Impaired judgment
	
## Chapter 4

decompression stop. - True

quantity of bubbles that are allowed to grow is by limiting the initial **Critical radius**

7. VPM is a Dual Phase Model that incorporates the theory that
bubbles of different ______Sizes______ have varying permeability.
8. RGBM differs from VPM in What Way? - VPM-B bases the entire ascent profile on bubble volume, while RGBM utilizes bubble volume to control the initial deep stops and then relies on a more traditional dissolved gas approach to calculate shallower stops.
