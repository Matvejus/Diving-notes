**Boyle's Law**
P1 V1 = P2 V2

Metric example:
A diver diving to 35 meters:

P1 = 1,
V1 = ?
P2 = 4.5
V2 = 1 (volume is smaller because at depth, the volume of breathed air is smaller)

Answer: V1 = 4.5.


### Dalton's Law
Dalton's law is the basis for most of the nitrox calculations.
Pg = Fg x P

Pg is partial pressure of the gas. Fg is the fraction of the gas, P is total pressure.

### Equivalent Air Depth

This calculation allows for the use of any air dive table with any mixture of nitrox.

Basically compares a dive on air to a dive on Nitrox.

(fN2 * (D + 10)/.79) - 10 = EADm

Case: We have nitrox EAN34, going to 27 meters what would be the depeth of nitrogen intake compare to a dive on air

fN2 = 100 - 34 = 66 = 0.66
D = 27

((0.66 * 37) / .79 ) - 10 = 20.9m

Meaning that if we would go to 27 m on Nitrox 34, it would equal to a dive on air to 20.9m

## Equipment

[[Key concept]]
Keep equipment free of hydrocarbon

### Dive planning
Dive planning must account for all gas requirements, oxygen limits and calculations, nitrogen limits and a strategy for tracking the dive, thermal considerations, and any other relative aspects that are needed in order to make the dive.

### Gas planning

[[Key concept]]
/**The process is knows as Respiratory Minute Volume, RMV. Amount of gas the diver moves in and out of their lungs in one minute**

A diver uses 15 bar of gas while swimming at 10m for 10 min. Diving with 11L cylinder that is full at 200 bar. What is the diver RMV

15 BAR * 11L = 165 L gas used at depth
Use Boyle's law to convert the consumption to surface volume.

165L/ 2 BAR = 82.5L surface equivalent / 10 minutes = 8.25L/min RMV

Example

A diver plans a dive to 30m for 50 minutes. The diver has an RMV of 20L/min. What is the total gas needed and the pressure that will be breathed from an 11L cylinder?

Depth = 30m
P = 4ata
RMV = 20 L/min
Cyl = 11L
Time = 50min

20L x 4 ata = 80L RMV at depth
80L/min x 50 min = 4000 L total gas needed for a dive
40000 L / 11L/bar = 364 bar needed for the dive in the cylinder
