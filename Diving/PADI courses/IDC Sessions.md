### Physics

#### Depth and Pressure
 0m (Sea level) - 1 bar/ata

A = athmospheric pressure - above the water
B = Gauge pressure (Hydrostatic) - below the water

Atmospheric - 1 ATA
----------------------------------
Gauge pressure (hydrostatic)
10m - 1ata
20m- 2 ata



### Fresh water - lighter

Calculating the pressure of fresh water

salt water 10m - 1ata
Fresh water 10.3m - 1.3ata


Atmospheric
Gauge/hydrostatic
Absolute


#### Boyle's law

6.42
30
6.75
0.83



volume - density - depth


the deeper you go, the more air you consume because the air is compressed


gas is always going from the higher pressure to the lower pressure


#### Bouyancy

The object is boyant is if the mass of the volume of water is equal to it's mass

If the weight of the displaced water is equal top the weight of the object than the object will be neutrally buoyant

fresh water  1L = 1kg
Salt water  1L = 1.03KG

if the neutraly boyant object in the water is neutraly boyant then the weight of the displaced volume is equal to the weight of the object



200 kg - object
75L sea water displaces = 77.25

200 kg - 77.25 = 122.75kg difference

122.75kg = 119.17L ~11 bar of 11.1L tank




350kg sunk at 35m displacing 100L

350kg = 339.8L

239.8L of air we need to make it neutral 


object weighs 100 kg
disiplaces 150L sea water = 154.5 kg

100 - 164.5 = 64.5kg







Charles law
1 degree celsius = +-0.6 bar


#### Light 

diffusion
refraction
absorbtion


objects are 4/3 bigger
objects are 25% closer

Turbility leads to visual reversal - farther and smaller

#### Sound
sound is 4 times faster




# Day 2 - Physiology

## Ears

![[Pasted image 20260212091144.png]]


1. Outer Ear - goes till ear drum
2. Middle ear - still a canal most affected
3. Inside ear - in the head

You equalize the middle ear

Ear drum is always bending because of pressure

long forceful equalization


### Middle ear squeeze 
body will produce blood to eaqualize the the ear

- Hearing reduced
- Ear feels full

### Ear drum rupture / broken

- Sharp pain/Strong pain then instant relief
- ear will feel cold - water is inside

## Reverse block
- happens only when we are ascending
- stop, wait, should go on itself

### Round window rapture
- long forceful equalization
- foreceful valsalva manoovre

### Vertigo
- Temperature difference
- Pressure difference - between ears

Baro trauma
Pressure Injury



## Resperatory system - breathing
## Cardiovascular system - heart and blood


![[Pasted image 20260212100042.png]]


Trachea - bronchi - bronchial - Alveoli

Alveoli are filled with cappilars - Wall of the alveoli


we breathe in because we need oxygen
we breath out because we need to get rid of co2

When we breathe is because we have too high levels of CO2


![[Pasted image 20260212101732.png]]



![[Pasted image 20260212102147.png]]


### Hypercapnia - too much CO2 carbon dioxide
- Shallow breathing
- Overexertion
- too much carbon dioxide
- skip breathing - breath in and hold for too long 

Deep slow breathing is important



Hypercapnia symptoms
- Headache
- Heavy and fast breathing
- Confusion
- Unconsciousness


## Carotid sinus reflex

- Tight hood
- Tight neck seal - drysuit
- Reduced the oxygen flow into your brain

- lightheaded
- fainting
- Uncomfortable
- Headache
- Choking



## Shallowater water blackout

not enough oxygen
partial pressure is to low

### Hypocapnia - not enough carbon dioxide

Hypocapnia leads to Hypoxia

Apnea - breath hold diving 


### Oxygen toxicity

### Carbon monoxide poisoning
Cherry red lips, Headache, Nausea

## Gas narcosis


### DCS 

### Lung overexpansion

AGE - air bubbles are going to your brain
Pneumothorax - lung collapse
Mediastinal emphisema - middle of your chest or in heart
Subcutaneous emphisema - under the skin



## HOT and COLD

#### Hot

Heat exhaustion'
- Pulse is fast + weak
- Sweating/Perspiration
- skin is cool and clammy

Heat stroke - body shutdown
- Pulse is fast and strong
- No sweat
- skin is dry and hot

#### Cold

Hypothermia - starting to get cold body is still working
- shivering
- reduce the blood flow

Advanced hypotermia - everything stops/body shuts down
- body shutdown


# Day 3 - Equipment and Deco



### Haldane 7 concepts

1. Descent - we absorb gas
2. Saturation - over time tissues absorb
3. Ascent - supersaturation, is when the pressure of gas is higher than the pressure of what you breathe with


RDP is based on 14  compartments
based on 60' min half time

wx Rule - 1h
yz - 3 hours

altitude diving - above 300m is altitude diving
special tables


## Equipment

compass lubber line - where you want to go
