### Physics

#### Depth and Pressure
 0m (Sea level) - 1 bar/ata

A = athmospheric pressure - above the water
B = Gauge pressure (Hydrostatic) - below the water

Atmospheric - 1 ATA
----------------------------------
Gauge pressure (hydrostatic)
10m - 1ata
20m- 2 ata



### Fresh water - lighter

Calculating the pressure of fresh water

salt water 10m - 1ata
Fresh water 10.3m - 1.3ata


Atmospheric
Gauge/hydrostatic
Absolute


#### Boyle's law

6.42
30
6.75
0.83



volume - density - depth


the deeper you go, the more air you consume because the air is compressed


gas is always going from the higher pressure to the lower pressure


#### Bouyancy

The object is boyant is if the mass of the volume of water is equal to it's mass

If the weight of the displaced water is equal top the weight of the object than the object will be neutrally buoyant

fresh water  1L = 1kg
Salt water  1L = 1.03KG

if the neutraly boyant object in the water is neutraly boyant then the weight of the displaced volume is equal to the weight of the object



200 kg - object
75L sea water displaces = 77.25

200 kg - 77.25 = 122.75kg difference

122.75kg = 119.17L ~11 bar of 11.1L tank




350kg sunk at 35m displacing 100L

350kg = 339.8L

239.8L of air we need to make it neutral 


object weighs 100 kg
disiplaces 150L sea water = 154.5 kg

100 - 164.5 = 64.5kg







Charles law
1 degree celsius = +-0.6 bar


#### Light 

diffusion
refraction
absorbtion


objects are 4/3 bigger
objects are 25% closer

Turbility leads to visual reversal - farther and smaller

#### Sound
sound is 4 times faster




# Day 2 - Physiology

## Ears

![[Pasted image 20260212091144.png]]


1. Outer Ear - goes till ear drum
2. Middle ear - still a canal most affected
3. Inside ear - in the head

You equalize the middle ear

Ear drum is always bending because of pressure

long forceful equalization


### Middle ear squeeze 
body will produce blood to eaqualize the the ear

- Hearing reduced
- Ear feels full

### Ear drum rupture / broken

- Sharp pain/Strong pain then instant relief
- ear will feel cold - water is inside

## Reverse block
- happens only when we are ascending
- stop, wait, should go on itself

### Round window rapture
- long forceful equalization
- foreceful valsalva manoovre

### Vertigo
- Temperature difference
- Pressure difference - between ears

Baro trauma
Pressure Injury



## Resperatory system - breathing
## Cardiovascular system - heart and blood


![[Pasted image 20260212100042.png]]


Trachea - bronchi - bronchial - Alveoli

Alveoli are filled with cappilars - Wall of the alveoli


we breathe in because we need oxygen
we breath out because we need to get rid of co2

When we breathe is because we have too high levels of CO2


![[Pasted image 20260212101732.png]]



![[Pasted image 20260212102147.png]]


### Hypercapnia - too much CO2 carbon dioxide
- Shallow breathing
- Overexertion
- too much carbon dioxide
- skip breathing - breath in and hold for too long 

Deep slow breathing is important



Hypercapnia symptoms
- Headache
- Heavy and fast breathing
- Confusion
- Unconsciousness


## Carotid sinus reflex

- Tight hood
- Tight neck seal - drysuit
- Reduced the oxygen flow into your brain

- lightheaded
- fainting
- Uncomfortable
- Headache
- Choking



## Shallowater water blackout

not enough oxygen
partial pressure is to low

### Hypocapnia - not enough carbon dioxide

Hypocapnia leads to Hypoxia

Apnea - breath hold diving 


### Oxygen toxicity

### Carbon monoxide poisoning
Cherry red lips, Headache, Nausea

## Gas narcosis


### DCS 

### Lung overexpansion

AGE - air bubbles are going to your brain
Pneumothorax - lung collapse
Mediastinal emphisema - middle of your chest or in heart
Subcutaneous emphisema - under the skin



## HOT and COLD

#### Hot

Heat exhaustion'
- Pulse is fast + weak
- Sweating/Perspiration
- skin is cool and clammy

Heat stroke - body shutdown
- Pulse is fast and strong
- No sweat
- skin is dry and hot

#### Cold

Hypothermia - starting to get cold body is still working
- shivering
- reduce the blood flow

Advanced hypotermia - everything stops/body shuts down
- body shutdown


# Day 3 - Equipment and Deco



### Haldane 7 concepts

1. Descent - we absorb gas
2. Saturation - over time tissues absorb
3. Ascent - supersaturation, is when the pressure of gas is higher than the pressure of what you breathe with


RDP is based on 14  compartments
based on 60' min half time

wx Rule - 1h
yz - 3 hours

altitude diving - above 300m is altitude diving
special tables


## Equipment

compass lubber line - where you want to go

### Introduction
The most important feature of my weight system is: a quick release that allows me to drop enough weight to float.

contact - has it ever happened to you that a zipper of your coat was stuck when you were trying to take off you jacket after coming home in the winter?

Overview of the topic: In diving it is very important that we can manage our equipment at any time. This is why the quick releasee that allows us to drop enough weight to float is the most important part of our weight system

Specific value of for the course: in confined water dive 4 we will practice the emergency weight drop, the weight quick release feature will be very useful during this skill

In PADI Open water E-learning section 1 equipment 1 you can find more information about types and features of different weight systems

### Body
Objective: The most important feature of my weight system is? There are multiple types of weight systems but today we will focus on the standard weight belt that you will use during the entire course

Local environment: On the open water dive 1 we will go to the sunset reef by boat, after we surface up and ready to go back on the boat, we will hand our weight belts to the crew of the boat, a quick release buckle will greatly help you and speed up the process

Apply to current course: Let's discuss the emergency weight drop once again. On the surface you wont have a working bcd. That will make you very negative and you will have to kick very hard to keep on the surface. Imagine that this scenario will happen in the open ocean, In the afternoon there could be small waves at sunset that would make even harder to be on the surface. That's why removing the weights fast is very important.

In the course peak performance boyancy we talk more about the correct weighting. There we train people to control their bouyancy not with excessive weights but with their lungs and correct positioning in the water. You will see, that some of our instructors on the course will use a different gear, like a wing with trim weight pockets on the top of the cam band to help with trimming or integrated weight systems bcd's that not only place the weight in a correct place but also allow you to drop it faster.


more questions and answers

### Summary
We will use the quick release feature many times during the course: during confined water and in the open water, so you will have opportunities to try it yourself

So. The most important feature of your weight system is: a quick release that allows me to drop enough weight to float.


### FAIL 
False information
If you give the body and don't answer the question


### Confined water

#### Briefing
#### Demonstration
#### Problem solving
#### Control and organization
#### Debriefing






Change order
Particular organization

We are in blue marlin pool


Length is 10M
width is 4M

1.2m
2.3m

4 students 
1 dive master


how to make sure the students can achieve it


#### Dive 2

8. Swim at least 50m while wearing scuba - move to the end

14-15 swap


#### Dive 3

8 -> 7
10 -> 8
8 ->9


#### Dive 4

Move 2 and 3? - makes sense to tow when the divers are on the surface at the end and after show how to release the cramp


Special organization

Dive 2. Skill 3: let students check themselves in buddy pairs, let on of them check the dive master.
dive 2. skill 4: let the divemaster demonstrate the entry
dive 2: skill 11-13: Place dm close to the student in case of panic or emergency

 
#### Briefing
1. Performance requirements - exact word for word from the manual
2. Value - why? Positive? why we do it
3. Describe how to do the skill - clear, step by step how to do the skill
4. Signals - signals for the skill, signals related to the skill. 
5. Organization - location (Shallow, deep, on the surface). Will you always demonstrate, say you will demonstrate. Talk about the positioning. Students will do it one by one?

#### Problem solving
You need to remind on how to do it correctly after the exercise

#### Control + delivery
2. Unorganized or waste time
3. Positioning
4. Communication - provide positive reinforcement
5. Environmental awareness

#### Debriefing
1. Positive reinforcement - something good relating the skill
2. Identify problems - be direct, tell exactly what the problem was 
3. Solution - how the problem should be solved
4. Performance requirement - read out from the instructor manual
5. Value - why this 





# DEMO 1 SKILL CONFINED - Breathe from an alternate air source supplied by another diver

I will have to demonstrate breathing by myself - do the entire scenario but don't go up.



The most important feature of my weight system is: a quick release that allows me to drop enough weight to float.



Open water course: question 9 - If I become separated from my buddy underwater, what
should I generally do?: Search for a minute underwater and then go up to find
my buddy.



### Knowledge presentation 1

### Introduction
Contact - For my sixths birthday me and my parents went to a Disneyland in Paris. We decided to use metro to get to the park, since it was a very convenient to get there. When we went inside the station there was an escalator and stairs that were both going down, so I decided to take the stairs and parents went with escalator. But after a couple of minutes I relalized that the they were going to a completely different stations. I ran back to the entrance and kept waiting for my parents and after a couple of minutes they've managed to find the way back. Of course we reunited and the rest of the day was amazing. Do you have any stories when you or some one you know got lost?

Overview of the topic: In diving it is very important to always be aware of your buddy and team, as well as to navigate and orient in the area where you are. But things happen, we can lose our buddies due to many reasons. That's why for cases like these PADI has developed practices and process that you must know and follow. If you become separated from your buddy, you should search for a minute underwater and then go up to find your buddy on the surface.

After we are done with out pool session we will go for the open water dive number 1. It will be your first experience of being underwater. It is very easy to get lost in the beauty of the underwater world and lose track of your team. Even though I will always be close to you it is very important to know what to do if you loose your team.

In you Open water e-learning Being a diver chapters talk a lot about how to work as team underwater, how to deal with different situation and how to use basic navigational skills underwater.


### Body
If you become separated from the buddy underwater, what should you generally do? Let's talk more about the correct process and tools you might need to safely end the dive and reunite with your team on the surface.

On our open water dive number 3 we will to to Halik, a beatuful wall divesite with lots of marine life. If we are lucky enough we might spot a white tip reef shark hiding in a cave. Usually Halik is a very calm dive site, but sometimes a light current might be there. And since it is such a good spot, many dive centers and divers go there, if you don't pay attention to your buddy and instructor while enjoying the dive you might loose your team, that's why knowing how to act will help you to deal with the situation

During this course you will be paired up with your buddy, it is your main concern to work as a team to make dives more safe and enjoyable. You will learn how to communicate underwater and how to use signaling devices. And besides that you will learn some navigational skills that will help you to understand where you are underwater.

I'd recommend you to do a padi underwater navigator course after to get even more familiar with navigation skills. And my favorite course: Search and recovery, where you will learn and practice how to find a lost item underwater

Now I have a question to you. Can you tell me how can we attract attention to us underwater? One of the ways is just to use a simple clip that you can bang on your tank, since the sound moves underwater 4 times faster than on surface, you will be definitely heard. And another question. What is our main concern besides safety stop when we are ascending? Right, to let the boats on surface know, that there are people under the water. For this I always carry a DSMB with me, it tells the boats that there are divers underwater and lets out boat know where we are. Both clips and DSMB you can get in our shop.


### Summary

During the dive we will always be working as a team, but if you become separated from your buddy underwater, what should you generally do?: Search for a minute underwater and then go up to find your buddy.







Can you give me an example of how we can make ourself heard or seen underwater?x
When we go up, what is our main concern?
