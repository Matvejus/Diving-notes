## PADI System Characteristics


1. Based on established Principles from Mainstream Education and Training

As you'll see in more detail in Learning, Instruction and the PADI System, PADI courses apply accepted learning theory and instructional systems design practices so that you teach diving in the ways that divers best learn.

2. Performance based

PADI programs apply specific, measurable learning and skill objectives. This reduces ambiguity for you and your students because you know what's expected, and it makes progress clear. Students move on by demonstrating they meet the objectives.

3. Student-Centered and Globally Consistent

The PADI System is designed for flexibility, allowing you to adapt a unified, standardized system to personal, physical, intellectual and cultural differences. PADI Divers enjoy individualized instruction that meets core minimum standards no matter where they're taught

4. Current

Backed by surveys, comments and interactions with the international PADI Membership, PADI courses remain relevant and leading-edge through on-going updates.  
  
These include dive equipment, dive practices and procedures content and the system itself including the instructional design practices, learning theory, and student and instructor media.

5. Proven

The PADI System was established in the 1960s and by the late 1980s had become diving’s dominant education system with full instructional media support for core courses.  
  
The PADI System has an established track record plus review and acceptance for higher education credit by mainstream education bodies including:

- American Council on Education
- Australia Nationally Recognized Training
- British Columbia External Credentials Program
- New Zealand Qualifications Authority

This makes the PADI System the most credible instructional system in diving.  
  
PADI courses meet or exceed industry standards, including those of the World Recreational Scuba Training Council (WRSTC) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

## Courses and Experiences

### Courses
Courses are PADI programs that result in a certification upon successful completion. An obvious example is the PADI Open Water Diver course

### Experiences
Experiences are PADI programs that don’t result in certification. Most PADI experiences have “Discover” in the name, such as the Discover Scuba Diving experience.

The broad term for anyone in any PADI program is participant. Participants are called student divers or students for diver-level courses, and candidates in leadership-level courses. Experience program participants are always called participants.

## PADI types of information

1. Course standards
These are the requirements within which you conduct a program, such as minimum age, student-to-instructor ratios, maximum depths, supervision and schedule requirements, etc.

2. Objectives and Performance Requirements
These describe what students must be able to do, during and by the end of the program.

3. Content
Delivered different ways and by different media, the content is the material learned during the program (more about this shortly).

4. Assessment
Assessment and evaluation allow participants to demonstrate what they’ve learned, as objectively and measurably as reasonably possible.

5. Support
This is anything that supports running a program such as technique suggestions, forms for completion or certification, background information, helpful external sources, promotional materials and publications that update PADI Standards and programs with revisions and changes.

### How do the media available affect your role as a PADI Instructor?

The media available varies by program, language and region, and this affects your role as an instructor.  
  
For a fully supported course, such as the PADI Open Water Diver course with materials in a language students understand, the media provide most of the course foundational content. In this case, your roles are to:  
  

- Assess, guide and reinforce knowledge development.  
      
    
- Adapt the course to individual student needs and the local dive environment.  
      
    
- Provide instructive predive briefings and inwater skill demonstrations.  
      
    
- Develop and assess learning as students apply what they’re learning.

  
For a course that has only an instructor guide, on the other hand, you have the same roles, plus you deliver the course content through predive briefings or formal class presentations.

### Thinking Like an Instructor

Professionals in any field know what tools they have available and stay up to date. Even if you don’t teach certain courses because you are not yet qualified or have no local application, your students and customers will expect you to be at least generally familiar with them, because you’re a PADI professional.

### PADI Standards
 
What is a standard in the PADI System and when do you have to follow standards?

In the PADI System, a standard is a training requirement that you must follow. You are responsible for following all the standards that apply to the PADI program you’re conducting.  
  
To help you identify them, boldface type identifies standards in instructor guides and the Training Bulletin. Headings may also be boldface, but that does not make everything under a heading a standard.  
  
Recommendations and suggestions are not in boldface. These are useful guidelines, but following them is based on your professional judgment.

![[Pasted image 20260201170131.png]]

### Purpose of standards

Safety

Standards set requirements intended to keep participants within boundaries of reasonable risk. These include minimum participant capabilities needed for a given situation, limits for supervision and control, student-to-instructor ratios and medical screening/clearances.

Instructuional Integrity and Quality

Standards set requirements that keep you within a reasonable instructional framework while applying the PADI System’s flexibility. These include required learning sequences, prerequisites, progress requirements and assessment requirements. Standards not only define minimum performances required by students at the end of a program, but also at stages within programs to establish foundations for subsequent learning.

Risk management

In addition to safety, standards require participants to complete and sign forms (on paper or electronically), and you to keep records and document the instructional process and your proper conduct as a professional. Participants also sign documents to acknowledge that they accept the risks associated with diving and the course. You learn more about this later.

Protect the PADI Family Reputation

Professional conduct standards set requirements for common honesty, supporting PADI values, cooperating with quality management, and interactions with clients and competitors.

### Code of Practice
 
Where do you find standards that apply to your code of practice as a PADI Professional?

The PADI Instructor Manual is your primary reference for finding standards in the PADI System. To help you start learning to use it, you’ll be prompted to find sections and look up examples.  
  
Access your PADI Instructor Manual now and refer to the relevant sections as you go.

### Commitment to Excellence

This section covers the requirements for your overall conduct as a PADI Professional.  
  
Here you find the PADI Member Code of Practice, which sets requirements related to safety, professionalism, interactions with program participants and other professionals, and applying good judgment to which you agree in your conduct as a PADI Pro.

Deviation from the code may result in losing your PADI Membership.

### General Standards

Where do you find standards that apply to all PADI programs?

Go to General Standards and Procedures and you’ll see that this section covers training and administrative standards that apply to all PADI programs.

- Equipment requirements  
    
- Participant to instructor ratios  
    
- Definitions of terms as they apply within the PADI System  
    
- Prerequisite certifications  
    
- Supervision levels and requirements  
    
- Special requirements for participants under 18 years of age

Each instructor guide provides standards and procedures that apply to the specific program. Important: Standards in the individual course guides override those in General Standards and Procedures, where applicable.

   For example

In General Standards and Procedures, it says:

- Conduct open water dives during daylight hours unless otherwise specified in the course instructor guide. 

In the Advanced Open Water Diver Course Instructor Guide, under the Night Adventure Dive, it says:

- Conduct this dive anytime between sunset and sunrise.  
    

The standard in the Advanced Open Water Diver Course Instructor Guide overrides the standards about conducting dives during daylight hours for  the Night Adventure Dive.

### Membership Standards

Where do you find standards that apply to your rating as a PADI Member?

The Professional Membership Guide covers standards that apply to you as a PADI Member (such as prerequisites, exit requirements and duties) for all PADI Professional ratings including TecRec, Freediver and Emergency First Response.  
  
You also find explanations of membership statuses, such as Active, Inactive, Teaching, Suspended, Nonteaching Medical, and so on.

## Course Links

You’ll find references to course links throughout PADI Instructor materials. Linking courses allows a dive or other accomplishment from one program to credit toward another program. This bridges programs and encourages divers to continue their training.  
  
References to links appear in individual guides, but General Standards and Procedures has the standards for linking courses in the Paperwork and Administrative Procedures section. Instructor qualifications and time limits may apply to links.

![[Pasted image 20260201171120.png]]

  For example

Discover Scuba Diving can link to the Open Water Diver course.  
  
When conducted by a Teaching status PADI Open Water Scuba Instructor, the Discover Scuba Diving experience credits as Confined Water Dive 1 if participants master all Open Water Diver Confined Water Dive 1 skills during the experience.

  For example

Open Water Diver can link to Rescue Diver.  
  
PADI Open Water Diver students may participate in Rescue Diver knowledge development and practice exercises in confined water. You may credit completed knowledge development toward Rescue Diver requirements.

Concurrent training options link the Open Water Diver course to some specialty diver courses. How these links work varies with the specialty, as described in the Instructor Manual, and you must be a specialty instructor for the linked course.

Unless specifically listed in the PADI Instructor Manual, linking does not allow you to combine the performance requirements for two or more dives so one dive credits for more than one rating.


### Standards Versus Recommendations

The PADI Instructor Manual provides standards in a concise format and PADI’s Guide to Teaching provides more detailed recommendations and suggested practices.

PADI’s Guide to Teaching is your main “how-to” reference as a PADI Instructor. It provides the “step-by-step recipe details” to the “basic recipes” in the Instructor Manual. The Guide to Teaching supports and restates some PADI Standards, but doesn’t include all of them.

PADI’s Guide to Teaching provides several types of information to help you as a PADI Instructor including teaching techniques and skill recommendations for PADI core courses and experiences. You’ll find recommendations for specific skill conduct, how to conduct and organize specific training dives and scheduling suggestions.

Any technique that doesn’t compromise safety, follows standards and meets the skill performance requirement is acceptable. Adapting techniques is common to meet local conditions, and when working with divers who have physical or mental challenges.

PADI’s Guide to Teaching also provides general considerations that apply across multiple programs, such as using certified assistants, more on linking courses and organizing multiple-level training. These considerations also talk about applying good judgment to different situations – something you always do when you’re thinking like an instructor.

### Regional Training Consultants

All PADI Regional Headquarters have Regional Training Consultants (RTCs) whose job is to help with training consultation, product choices, ordering and any other questions you may have. RTCs are upper level PADI Instructors (most are Course Directors) trained to assist you.

All PADI Regional Headquarters have Regional Training Consultants (RTCs) whose job is to help with training consultation, product choices, ordering and any other questions you may have. RTCs are upper level PADI Instructors (most are Course Directors) trained to assist you.  
  
The most important time to contact an RTC is when you have a question about the standards or recommendations that apply to a PADI training situation. This could be the case with unusual circumstances that PADI standards and recommendations don’t appear to address. Through contact with all PADI Regional Headquarters and access to the global PADI family experience, there’s a good chance that your situation has been addressed before.

If you’re not sure about PADI Standards or recommendations that apply, contact an RTC for guidance.

RTCs can help you in other ways, too:  
  

- They assist with appropriate instructor and student media including orders.

  

- If you’re not sure who to contact at your Regional Headquarters about something, your RTC can guide you to the right person.

  

- RTCs can help you find resources on the Pros’ Site and guide you through processes.

  
RTCs are available by telephone during your Regional Headquarters’ regular business hours, and by email. RTCs are there specifically to be your resource when you need them.

One of the most applied instructional models is Robert Gagné’s Conditions of Learning model. This model is the foundation for the PADI System. Gagné defined types of learning and events of instruction based on observed behaviors and results in training.  
  
Gagné’s model works well and continues in use because it:  
  

- Prescribes specific methods for instruction for different types of learning.  
      
    
- Is flexible, so it applies regardless of media, circumstances or culture.  
      
    
- Fits many types of teaching needs including aviation, scuba, medicine, emergency care and similar training applications.

The PADI System applies an instructional model that addresses what to teach and when. Although varied, the ability to learn in a given period is limited. It’s important to present what students need to learn without overwhelming them; exceeding this means a student will not learn everything presented.  
  
Sequence is important because we learn by building upon what we already know. Learning becomes difficult if instruction presents material that builds upon knowledge or skills that haven’t been learned yet. This is particularly important with entry-level student divers.

Instructional systems based on observable results, including the PADI System, apply performance requirements, learning objectives and mastery.  
  
The PADI philosophy is that instruction is concerned with what the learner knows and can do after training. Participants move on based on demonstrating they meet performance requirements or learning objectives at appropriate stages. This is called performance-based learning.

Also, in performance-based training, students don’t begin learning new knowledge or skills until they have demonstrated mastery of prerequisite knowledge or skills. This is more time-effective because it reduces delays caused by failure to have these.  
  
Performance-based training is about guiding learners to success. It adapts instruction to help students master performance objectives. Time-based training, by contrast, bases progress on time spent in class rather than on how fast students learn. This can unnecessarily hold back students who have learned, while advancing students who have not.  
  
Time is important: Student-instructor interactions and practice are part of learning, assessment and addressing individual needs, so students shouldn’t be rushed. Rather, time is not the objective but a tool you apply to help students reach the performance requirements.

Objectives (also called “learning objectives” or “study objectives”) are student-centered and define what learners should be able to do at different training stages. They are written to be observable, specific and measurable, and clearly state that the learner will be able to “list,” “demonstrate,” “identify” or “explain.”

The PADI System focuses on what the student must be able to do – objectives – not a specific technique.

This makes the system flexible in meeting individual student characteristics. Focusing on the requirement helps foster a positive mindset when a student has difficulty. Instead of “doing well” or “poorly," the student either meets the requirement or does not meet it yet.

### Mastery

For waterskills, mastery is defined as performing a skill so it meets the stated performance requirements in a reasonably comfortable, fluid, repeatable manner as would be expected of a diver at that certification level. You assess whether the student can reasonably be expected to perform the skill adequately when it is required in diving circumstances.

![[Pasted image 20260201213801.png]]

  
For knowledge development, the student demonstrates mastery as described in General Standards and Procedures under Paperwork and Administrative Procedures, as well as within individual course guides. You’re assessing whether the student would recall and apply the knowledge when appropriate in diving circumstances.

![[Pasted image 20260201213830.png]]

# Learning Readiness and Repetition

People learn best when they’re ready to learn – that sounds simple, but it can be complex. Students must be intellectually, psychologically and physically ready.

#### Intellectual Readiness

Means students have the knowledge on which their learning builds.

#### Psychological Readiness

Means student are mentally “there” and receptive.

#### Physical Readiness

Means students have the skills to build upon what they’re learning, they have the physical ability to do what they’re learning, and there are no significant physical discomforts diverting their attention.


## Categories of Learning

#### 1 - Verbal Information

Verbal information is facts, such as names, and information you apply while diving. Divers learn verbal information by reading, watching videos, asking and answering questions, and through discussions. Divers reinforce this information by applying what they learn.

  In the PADI System, examples include:
Identifying types of gear, fish species, what a pneumothorax is, and what you’re learning now – definitions of the five broad categories of learning.

#### 2 – Intellectual Skills

Intellectual skills consist of knowing how and why various results occur, how to cause or prevent them, how to respond to them when they do, and other procedures. Divers learn intellectual skills by reading about them, watching videos or demonstrations of them, and by practicing their application.

Verbal information and intellectual skill development often integrate. Students learn associated foundational verbal information in connection with intellectual skills. This integration continues as students apply broader concepts to local diving circumstances

#### 3 – Motor Skills

Motor skills are physical body movements. Divers learn motor skills by seeing them performed correctly either live, by visualizing them, or in media, followed by practice and repetition.

#### 4 – Cognitive Strategies

Cognitive strategies consist of higher-order thinking skills. These higher-level mental abilities are the thinking approaches to solving and learning, and are perhaps the least easily defined instructionally. Divers learn cognitive strategies by applying other knowledge and skills to new situations in which they have to create answers and solutions.

#### 5 – Attitudes

Attitudes are a person’s tendencies to make various choices. Knowledge and values shape basic attitudes. Divers adopt attitudes based on knowledge, experience and the examples they see set by other people. They are more likely to adopt the attitudes, values and behaviors – desirable or undesirable – of people they respect.

Shaping positive attitudes via course materials, discussions and interactions with you, along with your behavior as a role model.  
  
The PADI System teaches the desirability of choices for safety and the environment, and requires students to demonstrate their ability to make those choices; ultimately, some students will choose differently in spite of their training.

Attitudes can shape and affect the application of intellectual skills and cognitive strategies. It’s difficult to measure attitude and the choices a diver will make, but you can assess the knowledge and ability to make a choice, such as choosing to follow safe diving practices by making safety stops at the end of dives, and choosing to be careful when near sensitive aquatic life.


The PADI System classifies learning as Knowledge Development, Waterskills and in some cases, Practical Application, based on the circumstances in which the student learns. Each of these supports all five categories in different ways.


### Events of instruction

#### 1 – Gain Attention

This benefits learning by getting students to focus on the topic. Sometimes called a “contact,” it can be anything related or unrelated, but analogous, which stimulates interest.  
  
In the PADI System, you may see this as an interesting story, question or motivational imagery at the start of a learning section.  
  
This step is important because cognitive psychology has shown repeatedly that the human mind can only pay attention to one thing at a time. Instruction is only possible when the student pays attention to what’s being taught. This is especially important to note with “multitasking” common to many modern cultures.

#### 2 – Inform Students of the Objectives

This benefits learning by making students active learners who know what’s expected and whether they’re learning what they need to.  
  
PADI manuals and eLearning have objective boxes or objectives that display sequentially within learning. These objectives are typically phrased as questions, which helps students guide their study by looking for the answers.  
  
In PADI materials, waterskills have performance requirements that state what students should be able to do. Waterskills performance requirements are usually introduced and reinforced by video previews and photos, as well as by you during water session.

#### 3 – Remind Students of What They’ve Already Learned

Formally called “stimulate recall of prerequisite learning,” this benefits learning because students connect previously mastered related knowledge and skills with new ones. Providing direction to these assists these connections.  
  
PADI media often say “as you already learned” and “as discussed in the previous section” to create these ties.  
  
Teaching waterskills, you might say, “You’ve all shown me you can clear your masks. Now we’re going to combine that with taking it off completely.”

#### 4 – Present the Content

Students read, watch and listen to the material they’re learning, which is the main point of instruction. In supported courses, the student media provide much of the course content. To aid learning, media may overlap, presenting the content more than once in different ways, such as in text, still images, interactive graphics and video.

#### 5 – Provide Learning Guidance

This benefits learning by providing strategies and suggestions to learn and apply the content. This commonly integrates with presenting content, such as teaching divers to remember predive safety check steps with BWRAF. Other examples include how to best study with eLearning or manual in the media introductions.  
  
Linking content to what students know or will learn also helps. In PADI media, statements such as,“As you’ll see during your open water dive...” and “When you became an Open Water Diver...”establish these links.  
  
You guide attitudes with role model behavior.****

#### 6 – Learner Performance

Students demonstrate use of the new knowledge. This benefits learning by allowing students and the instructor to assess their progress.  
  
In PADI student media, this commonly takes the form of short interactive exercises, sometimes called “quick quizzes” or “knowledge checks.” Knowledge Reviews are part of this process, too.  
  
During briefings and presentations, you can ask questions or start discussions that assess learning. With motor skills, students practice the skill.


#### 7 – Provide Results

Coupled with the performance, providing results informs students as to how they did as they progress, along with further learning guidance as needed. This benefits learning by building confidence, as well as by encouraging students to continue to study or practice if they’re not yet meeting the objective.  
  
In PADI student materials, knowledge checks provide the correct answer. Explanations are either provided or the medium allows students to easily go back to review, or both.  
  
With waterskills, you provide feedback, but often the skill does that by itself. For example, divers will know if they’ve cleared a mask or if they’re hovering. But, they may need guidance about what to correct if unsuccessful, or about ways to improve.  
  
If unsuccessful, students review what they’re learning and repeat the performance to progress toward mastery. Emphasize that they have not yet met the objective but they are on the right track.


#### 8 – Assess the Performance

This differs from the previous check in that its role is to confirm that learning is complete to the desired level and meets the objective. It benefits learning by confirming that the student is ready to move on.  
  
In the PADI System, this often takes the form of exams or demonstration, but also through application. For example, in the Underwater Navigator course, students confirm mastery of basic compass navigation and its underlying verbal information and intellectual skills by navigating lines and patterns.  
  
You assess attitudes and cognitive strategies through discussions and interaction.


#### 9 – Aid Retention and Transfer

The final step is to provide learners with strategies for recalling and reapplying what they’ve learned. This benefits learning because it provides additional repetition, and develops cognitive strategies.  
  
In the PADI System, this is often integrated as students practice new skills, which provides additional skill repetition, as well as prerequisite knowledge. Additional dive opportunities and continuing education build retention and transfer.  
  
Debriefings and other post-dive activities help learners mentally rehearse and reapply what they’ve learned. This is one reason they’re included frequently in the PADI System. Using them effectively can enhance student learning and enjoyment significantly.

- Prerequisite learning includes the motor skills of regulator clearing and basic buoyancy control.  
      
    
- It also requires the verbal information, intellectual skill and attitude to maintain buddy contact, know what the alternate is, recognize hand signals and know when to apply the skill. Learning this skill repeats and reinforces all of these.  
      
    
- Attention is gained and objectives are provided in student media and repeated by the instructor.  
      
    
- Content is presented, performance is practiced, and feedback and guidance are received during initial skill practice and mastery.  
      
    
- Repetition and transfer are enhanced during alternate air source ascent training and additional repetitions in free time or on minidives.  
      
    
- Performance is assessed during open water training, simultaneously enhancing retention and transfer through repetition and application in a new situation.

## The Role of Standards in Instruction

This illustrates that effective instruction considers what you don’t teach as well as what you do. Standards are one way the PADI System guides you with this.  
  
In the PADI System Overview, you learned that PADI Standards are training requirements that you must follow when conducting PADI programs. You also learned that they exist for safety, instructional integrity and quality, risk management and the PADI family’s standing in the public eye. In this topic, we’ll look at their instructional role in the PADI System.

Learning objectives and sequencing standards address what the student should be learning and when. It is important to set these boundaries because sequencing ensures that students master prerequisites that subsequent knowledge and skills build upon.  
  
Knowledge development typically establishes foundational knowledge in sequence that students next apply as they learn skills based on it in diving circumstances.

Within the required sequencing, though, you have significant flexibility:  
  

- Students can usually complete all Knowledge Development ahead of time, or it can be distributed between dives.  
      
    
- Students can complete the independent study for all their chosen Adventure Dives in the Advanced Open Water Diver course before the first dive, or they can complete the independent study for each Adventure Dive as you conduct them in sequence.  
      
    
- A few training dives allow Knowledge Development to follow. With these, predive briefings can adequately cover the knowledge students need to learn to be successful.  
      
    
- You usually have latitude to change the skills sequence within a dive, and in the PADI Open Water Diver course some skills are Dive Flexible, meaning that within guidelines you can choose the dive most logistically suited for certain skills.


## Meeting Versus Exceeding **Standards**

In meeting learning objective or performance requirement standards, it’s important to teach to objectives, which obviously means meeting them, but also not exceeding what the objective calls for.

Meeting the performance requirement demonstrates that students have mastered the skill and are ready to continue in the program, and ultimately, qualify for certification.  
  
Exceeding a performance requirement, on the other hand, is requiring a performance significantly more difficult than what is called for.

Students may not be prepared for a more complicated performance, which means failure is more likely and more time would be needed than if following a more proper instructional sequence.  
  
It undermines confidence. Students may see the demand as overwhelming and have little confidence in attaining it. Failing may reduce their confidence in diving as a whole.  
  
By contrast, when students learn to objectives they’re more likely to believe they can meet the requirements and to see mistakes and retries as learning rather than failure.

## Adapting, Developing and Assessing

#### Adapting course content to local circumstances and individual student needs and abilities.

Examples of how you may adapt course content include:  
  

- Teaching the Rescue Diver course in cool climates and emphasizing rescue-breathing techniques that work well with thick wet suits and dry suits.  
      
    
- Helping an Open Water Diver student with low back weakness meet entry and exit performance requirements with techniques that do not require standing wearing full scuba.  
      
    
- Presenting course material verbally instead of through independent study for a student with a diagnosed learning disability that affects reading.

With entry-level divers, making conservative judgments reduces risk while demonstrating for students how to do the same. With higher level students, you demonstrate how you make judgments that may affect other divers.


## Reasons for Role-Modeling

#### 1 – Students learn a lot by following your example.

This ranges from how to perform or apply learning, to when.

#### 2 – Your example influences choices.

As you learned, role models are important in teaching attitudes, and this particularly applies to good judgment.

When students see your personal predive safety checks, it reinforces their choice to follow their training and do the same when diving outside of instruction.

## Be a Role Model

To be a good role model, keep these points in mind:  
  
- Show conviction by doing what you teach, all the time – not just in classes. Students are still learning, even when you’re not teaching.  
      
- Avoid hypocrisy. “Do as I say, not as I do” undermines your credibility and professionalism.  
      
- Be accessible and visible – divers can only benefit from actions they see. If something may appear contradictory, take the time to set things straight. For example, if new divers will share a boat with tec divers, make it clear that tec divers are trained and equipped for decompression dives, not violating the recreational diver practice of only making no stop dives.  
      
- Show humility. No one knows everything, so don’t be afraid to admit it when you don’t know something. Honest vulnerability enhances your credibility.

- Pay attention to your staff. They should reflect your role model values and behaviors.

## Discover scuba diving and Experience programs

Now, as a PADI® Professional, you’ll be in a position to provide new divers with an equally well planned and memorable first experience. This is one of your most important responsibilities, and the future of the dive industry, and divers’ collective protection of the aquatic world, depends on how well you meet it.  
  
New divers are the lifeblood of the dive industry. Like any business, every customer is important, but new customers allow a business to grow. Without new people walking through the door, dive centers, resorts and instructors will not flourish. Because new divers are so important, these PADI programs are designed to welcome people and start them toward certification. We’ll go over these programs today and you’ll continue to learn about them throughout the IDC

###  Get People in the water

The Dive Today philosophy is simple: You lead with the experience. This is particularly important when introducing people to diving or snorkeling.  
  
People should discover the thrill of breathing underwater themselves, first. This helps overcome their objections and motivates them to continue. A lot of academics or long classroom sessions turn many people off, especially if they just want to try diving to see if they like it. Other competing recreational activities allow people to participate quickly, so starting with an underwater experience is important.  
  
The Dive Today philosophy takes the approach that anyone who is diving is a diver, or anyone who is snorkeling is a snorkeler. Any time you breathe off scuba underwater, you are diving – even if it’s only in a pool. Similarly, any time you use a mask and snorkel to look underwater, you are snorkeling. This simple approach is inclusive. First-time participants feel welcomed by the dive community and not like beginners who don’t belong.

To incorporate the Dive Today philosophy into PADI experience programs or PADI courses, you need to get people into the water as soon as possible.

Of course, safety is the primary concern, so you need to explain the breathing rules. But you don’t need long briefings or extensive knowledge development sessions before letting people sink down a bit below the surface to experience diving.


### Discover Scuba diving

Discover Scuba Diving also fulfills other goals including:

•

Dispelling common misconceptions about diving by letting people experience how easy it is.

•

Letting people work through any anxiety about diving in a controlled environment.

•

Allowing people with physical and/or mental challenges, and others who may not be able to meet all the performance requirements for full certification, to enjoy and benefit from scuba diving.

•

Quickly overcoming objections people may have about whether they will really enjoy scuba diving.

•

Offering instant gratification by making it easy to try diving.

•

Getting people excited about enrolling in an Open Water Diver course.


You must use the Discover Scuba Diving Participant Guide, the Discover Scuba Diving Cue Card or the Discover Scuba Diving Flip Chart to help you cover this important information. Then you have participants complete and sign the Discover Scuba Diving Participant Guide, which includes all required paperwork and the Discover Scuba Diving Knowledge and Safety Review.

- In a pool, you help them with gear, explain BCD inflation and deflation at the surface, then let them breathe underwater and swim around. If they are comfortable, you can closely supervise them as they swim around in deeper water.  
      
    
- In confined open water, you also introduce and have participants practice the skills listed in the skill performance requirements before taking them on a tour of the area.  
      
    
- Always conclude with a debriefing that encourages these new divers to enroll in a course. Be sure to point out the benefits listed in the Participant Guide, such as more information about the PADI Open Water Diver course and a preview of Open Water Diver eLearning.  
      
    
- There is also a page in the Participant Guide to log the confined water experience. Logging the dive is a great way to make participants feel welcome as new divers.


If participants will go on an open water dive, a PADI Instructor must introduce and have participants meet the skill performance requirements listed in Section Three.

It’s very important to give these new divers your full attention. There are very specific requirements regarding supervision of Discover Scuba Diving participants. Refer to the topic Supervision in your Discover Scuba Diving Program Instructor Guide.

- You must not leave participants unattended, either at the surface or underwater.

  

- You need to position yourself so that you or a certified assistant can make immediate physical contact with, adjust buoyancy for, and render assistance to, participants.

  

- You must continually observe participants with only the brief, periodic interruptions needed to lead the dive and to provide assistance to individual divers.

  

- Do not engage in any other activities, such as taking photographs or video, while supervising participants.

  

- Remember that participants only know a few basic skills. Your focus must be on their safety first and making the dive experience enjoyable second.

  

- Be sure to have participants log the open water dive in their participant guides.

### Register DSD participants

You need to register participants with your PADI Regional Headquarters within seven days of their experience. Register participants online in the PADI Online Processing Center. If that’s not possible, either use the registration portion of the Discover Scuba Diving Participant Guide or the Discover Scuba Diving Program Registration form (10119).

Registering participants is important because you get credit for your activities toward advancing your PADI ratings. It also provides quality management data and allows PADI Regional Headquarters to officially acknowledge participants’ achievements and welcome them.

### Linking the Program



### Reactivate

The program has two components: a knowledge review and a dive skills refresher.

- Divers refresh their knowledge using ReActivate eLearning and receive a completion certificate that they bring to you.

  

- You verify that divers completed the ReActivate Quick Review and review it with them.

  

- Conduct a predive interview with each diver. Check the diver’s log book (if available) and ask questions about experience and recent dives.

  

- Conduct the program prescriptively – some divers may want a lot of review and reminders, while others may only want a supervised dive to regain confidence.

  

- It’s highly recommended you use the PADI Skill Practice and Dive Planning Slate. Ask divers to indicate their level of comfort with each skill. Conduct any skills needing more practice during the water skills session.

  

- Use the PADI Online Processing Center to process a replacement PADI certification card with a “ReActivated Thru” date, which is two years after the program completion.

### Skin diver

Because most people don’t consider snorkeling a sport that takes practice, PADI’s philosophy regarding snorkeling is to guide and assist rather than instruct.

- People snorkel because they want to see and interact with the underwater world. You can help them do this with just a little guidance through a program called Discover Snorkeling.  
      
    
- Snorkelers may not want to be scuba divers. As a dive professional, you naturally want to turn everyone into scuba divers, but many snorkelers have no interest in scuba and actually don’t want to be around divers.  
      
    
- If you take a helpful, rather than an instructive, approach, you’ll find that most snorkelers will seek you out when they need you, and will otherwise happily enjoy the experience. Those who are interested in scuba diving will then feel comfortable asking you about taking that next step

-   
    Enjoy themselves while building confidence in their skin diving ability.

  

- Develop good judgment about the dive environment.

  

- Gain experience under the supervision of a PADI Professional.

### Programs for children

Many instructors find teaching children enjoyable and rewarding, however, others don’t. It’s important that you are comfortable teaching children before you do it. If you do not wish to teach children, don’t.  
  
When supervising and teaching children, dive professionals have a higher duty of care. Children aren’t developmentally mature and thus need closer attention, supervision and more direction than adults.

It is prudent for all members to be aware of the issues, remain above reproach and follow established codes of conduct. You can demonstrate your positive and healthy practices when teaching children by:

- Keeping parents involved when teaching children.

  

- Having other adults present during training.

  

- Maintaining professional conduct, positive appearance and good attitude at all times.

When accepting children ages 10 or 11 into a Discover Scuba Diving experience that includes a confined open water or open water dive, have the parent and child view the Youth Diving: Responsibilities and Risks video or use the flip chart prepared especially for this purpose. Both parent and child then complete and sign the Youth Diving: Responsibilities and Risks Acknowledgment form.


### PADI Bubblemaker

The first PADI program designed specifically for children is Bubblemaker. The goal is very simple: to introduce children to the underwater world under close supervision.  
  
Many PADI Members have had great success with this program conducting Bubblemaker birthday parties or offering regular Bubblemaker play days at their local pool.  
  
Children who have a great time as Bubblemakers will go home and get their parents and siblings so excited about diving that the whole family often ends up trying scuba. Bubblemaker can be a very effective diver-acquisition program.

### PADI Seal team program

When children have fun as Bubblemakers and want to keep diving, the next step is PADI Seal Team. The goal of the PADI Seal Team program is to keep youngsters diving, learning and having fun until they are ready to enroll in a PADI Junior Open Water Diver course. Of course, children don’t need to start as Bubblemakers, but can jump straight in and join the PADI Seal Team.  
  
To become official PADI Seal Team members, children must complete the first five of 15 AquaMissions. These confined water dives develop fundamental scuba skills and knowledge that may count later toward scuba certification.  
  
For PADI Master Seal Team membership, PADI Seal Team members complete an additional 10 Specialty AquaMissions and independently assemble and disassemble their scuba equipment

## PADI Open Water Training

- The course is open to everyone who is 10 years or older and meets the medical reqs

This is based on the idea that learning to dive is not overly complicated or difficult for most people, but it requires instruction and guided practice to develop and confirm the basic knowledge and skills needed.  
  
The course’s performance-based design allows beginning divers to progress at their own pace, using their strengths to meet certification requirements.

- People become divers to experience and enjoy the underwater world

However, people have different ideas about what makes diving enjoyable. Seeking adventure, taking on challenges, making new friends, interacting with nature or a combination of these are common motivations.  
  
The course develops the concepts and skills beginning divers need, while making it clear there is more to learn to enhance what they get out of diving.

- Divers and diving have a role in making the world a better place
  
Many people don’t come to diving for this reason, but direct experience with the beauty and fragility of the underwater realm tends to make divers powerful advocates for protecting aquatic ecosystems, which are essential parts of the global ecosystem on which we rely.  
  
In addition, diving has a demonstrated therapeutic power that benefits people faced with social, physical and intellectual challenges. Divers help spread the word to those who can most benefit from this.


- Diving is a cross-cultural passioin the bridges countries, ethnic backgrounds and socio-economic differences

The PADI Open Water Diver course goals embrace its philosophy to:

- Teach divers to dive properly with a buddy, independent of professional supervision, while applying the knowledge and skills they learn in the course.  
      
    
- Teach divers to plan and participate in dives in the local environment or in areas with conditions similar to or better than those they experience in training.  
      
    
- Encourage divers to be active in the dive lifestyle, socially, continuing their education and diving often.  
      
    
- Encourage divers to be vocal and active enthusiasts promoting the preservation and protection of the delicate underwater world.  
      
    
- Encourage divers to share their love for diving and see themselves as part of the diverse global community of divers.

  
The PADI Open Water Diver course is unmatched in its effectiveness, performance and quality – as are PADI’s other training programs and the PADI Professionals who provide them.

Issued by the world’s largest and most prominent diver training organization, PADI certifications are recognized by dive professionals virtually everywhere.

Friends and family who’ve taken the PADI Open Water Diver course commonly recommend it. More than half of new PADI Divers start with a recommendation from a friend or family member.

  
With independent eLearning or print material options, and diverse schedule options, the course’s flexibility fits today’s busy schedules and frees you to focus on students’ practical needs and interests.  
  
Since the introduction of the PADI modular scuba course in 1978, the course has been revised multiple times to keep it current.

The independent recognition of the PADI System and PADI courses by mainstream higher education bodies such as the American Council on Education and similar authorities internationally, coupled with the PADI Quality Management processes, gives consumers confidence in the courses you offer.

### Subcourse Roles


- To help with schedule issues. Divers with full schedules or short holidays can complete PADI Scuba Diver in a couple of days. They can complete the rest of PADI Open Water Diver later or on a subsequent holiday.  
      
    
- To credit accomplishment despite interruptions. Sometimes divers must interrupt their participation in the PADI Open Water Diver course due to sudden schedule changes or emergencies. These students can receive the PADI Scuba Diver certification if they have met its requirements.  
      
    
- Some divers can’t qualify as PADI Open Water Divers, but do meet PADI Scuba Diver requirements, allowing you to certify them. This can be the case with some divers with physical or mental challenges.  
      
    
- Some divers only want to dive relatively shallow with a professional leading them. PADI Scuba Diver provides a simpler certification for these divers.  
      
    
- Allows for a smaller first step. This is important because some people want to see how diving and becoming a diver fit their interests and lifestyle before making an extensive commitment. PADI Scuba Diver is a smaller commitment, usually switchable to PADI Open Water Diver during the course for students who quickly discover their love for diving.

### Lead with Diving

The Dive Today philosophy is that training leads with the dive experience. The opportunity to try diving is available as quickly as possible, ideally immediately, the same day. This applies equally to those interested in diving and those already committed by enrolling.  
  
Dive Today is possible because lengthy knowledge development sessions aren’t necessary for those interested in just trying diving – if anything, they tend to discourage participants

- Give the Discover Scuba Diving briefing.  
      
    
- For participants who master Open Water Diver Confined Water Dive 1 skills, you may credit the dive toward the PADI Open Water Diver course. This encourages participants to continue to certification.  
      
    
- You can brief Open Water Dive 1 with participants who master Confined Water Dive 1 skills. They are eligible for credit for the dive by meeting the performance requirements.  
      
    
- Because the briefings include what participants need to know for the dive, those continuing into the Open Water Diver course may complete the full Knowledge Development 1 after the dive.

### Orientation Session

An orientation is simply a nontraining meeting with students before beginning the actual class. The purposes and need vary depending upon circumstances, but may include:

- Meeting the staff and classmates.  
      
    
- Orientation to the facilities.  
      
    
- Confirming schedule and locations.  
      
    
- Reviewing study requirements, such as when to complete independent study sections.  
      
    
- Equipment requirements and fitting.  
      
    
- Collecting fees along with completing paperwork and documents not completed online.  
      
    
- Promoting your courses by having students invite friends to participate.


#### Orientation Options
1. Keep them social
2. Get out of the classroom
3. Include the gear
4. Make your expectations clear
5. Timing is important
6. Be available


Like all PADI courses, the PADI Open Water Diver course has tremendous flexibility in how you schedule it. There are a lot scheduling options, but here are a few to consider in setting up your courses.

You may combine Knowledge Development sessions and also combine Confined Water Dives, provided students meet performance requirements in sequence. You can resequence skills within a dive, but not move skills between dives, except dive flexible skills.

It’s most common to complete all knowledge development and confined water training before the first open water dive, but you have other scheduling options:

- Open Water Dive 1 may follow Confined Water Dive 1.  
      
    
- Open Water Dive 2 may follow Knowledge Development 1, 2, 3 and Confined Water Dives 1, 2 and 3 and the 10 minute swim/float.  
      
    
- Open Water Dives 3 and 4 follow Knowledge Development 4 and 5, and Confined Water Dives 4 and 5.  
      
    
- Students must master dive flexible skills in confined water before performing them in open water, except compass navigation and inflatable signal tube use; and the emergency weight drop may be conducted in confined or open water.  
      
    
- Ideally, distribute dive flexible skills over several dives.


### Preparing to teach

1. Review the standards and suggested teaching techniques in the PADI Instructor Manual, General Standards and Procedures and Open Water Diver Course Instructor Guides, and PADI’s Guide to Teaching.  
      
    
2. Review the student materials, including the Knowledge Reviews, quizzes and final exam.  
      
    
3. Get your teaching materials together and be sure they’re the current version and are ready to use.  
      
    
4. Have any paperwork that will not be completed online prepared to distribute in advance. This includes the Quick Review for eLearners, as well as printed quizzes and exams for those who use paper.  
      
    
5. Organize and confirm the function of dive gear you’ll need, including your personal equipment, floats, first aid kit, oxygen kit, spare gear, etc.  
      
    
6. Be sure any equipment that will be provided for student use is ready.  
      
    
7. Organize, schedule and confirm confined and open water logistics as necessary. For example, book a pool or register with the dive boat. It’s helpful to post the schedule for students to download or print for reference.  
      
    
8. Determine how many assistants you need and want, contact them and schedule to meet with them ahead of time to plan logistics and responsibilities.  
      
    
9. Plan social activities after sessions and courses. Get-togethers, picnics or barbecues, and graduation parties are appropriate and require thought and planning.

## Risk management and Legal Considerations

Risk management practices act as your best, ongoing process to provide for the safety of the divers in your care. And, even if you do everything properly and professionally, problems can still arise and you could face allegations that you did not.  
  
Besides helping to prevent accidents in the first place, the attitudes, judgments, techniques and tools inherent in good diving risk management can also help you to defend yourself should an accident occur, by helping to guide and document your reasonable behavior and practices.  
  
The professional liability insurance you carry can reduce the burden of a claim against you.  
  
Risk management is every dive professional’s business.

During the discussion about Regulations, you’ll learn what regulations affect teaching diving and your responsibilities as a dive professional.


### Most Important Task

<b>Diver Safety</b>

Simply stated, a dive professional’s most important task is striving to improve diver safety. Diving has inherent risks that can never be fully eliminated, but as dive instructors, whether teaching or supervising, we directly affect diver safety.  
  
We must always be aware that a serious dive accident – especially a fatality – is a tragedy for the victim, for the victim’s family and for the dive professionals and businesses involved.  
  
We must always be aware as dive professionals that providing for the safety of our students and supervised divers is our single-most important task.

Four goals of improving diver safety

1. To provide for the safety and well-being of divers everywhere
2. To provide liability protection for dive professionals, dive stores, dive boat and the dive industry as a whole
3. To maintain the availability of proffessional dive insurance
4. To maintain divings relations and image with the public

### Legal Considerations

#### Litigation

An incident in which a diver is hurt or dies can result in a lawsuit that accuses you of causing, or contributing to, the incident. Litigation of this type seeks payment to address damages those suing claim you owe. Most of this section discusses risk management related to litigation.

#### Regulations

Regulations are requirements imposed by local governments, and may include licensing, permits and safety requirements for students and you. Thanks to diving’s excellent safety record, these tend to be less for scuba instructors than some other professionals, but in many areas they are in effect.

#### Licensing and Copyright

Licensing and copyright, coupled with your PADI Membership agreement, define how you legally can and can’t use the PADI trademarks and PADI materials. You’ll learn about this in IDC eLearning section 9 – PADI Quality Management and Licensing.




- The best defense for a lawsuit is not being sued in the first place. You won’t be sued for incidents that don’t happen.  
      
    
- Sometimes it’s not immediately clear what permits, licenses, workplace requirements and other regulations apply to diving. When in doubt about following a regulation, usually the best choice is to follow it while getting more information.  
      
    
- Following licensing requirements strictly and getting permission before doing something that may infringe a copyright or trademark goes a long way toward preventing problems.


### Litigation - Introduction and Issues


#### 1 – A higher percentage of incidents seem to result in litigation

This is occurring even though diving presently has the lowest fatality rate it has ever had since records first began to be analyzed in the late 1960s – with a continuing downward trend.  
  
Besides a higher percentage, this trend includes naming more parties in the filed lawsuits, and frequently, those named are only remotely involved, if at all. Besides an instructor and dive store, suits may name dive boats, equipment manufacturers, boat divemasters and captains, dive organizations and so on.

#### 2 – Litigation is becoming increasingly international

The idea that only large countries are likely to have dive lawsuits and government intervention is no longer true, if it ever was. Lawsuits, coroner’s inquests and other actions have increased everywhere.


### Situational Awareness

Situational awareness and attention to detail are vital to managing risk because lapses can have serious implications.

Maintain awareness and follow well-documented and planned procedures. As you’ll learn in the next topic, courts are typically less concerned with your intentions than with what you did. Approach instructing by paying attention to details the way you do with other aspects of diving.

Dive accidents have occurred because a professional ignored or simply forgot the routine, standard steps that were supposed to be followed.  
  
Documentation, training standards, predive checks and so on are all important. Think like an instructor and take the time to be sure they’re all accounted for every time for each student diver


### Duty of Care and Law suits

When divers come to you for supervision or instruction, in most legal systems you have a legal relationship and you’re said to have a duty of care – an obligation to reasonably protect the well-being of less knowledgeable divers under your supervision.

You need to be vigilant and assess risk before, during and after a dive, using sound, conservative judgment to reduce risk as required.  
  
As a professional, you are expected to have the appropriate skills and equipment required to respond to an emergency and to be able to do so correctly.

Given the legal relationship, you’re expected to conduct yourself as a reasonably prudent scuba instructor. This means that you make good decisions, are prepared for the situations that may arise, and follow appropriate standards and local protocols.  
  
A reasonably prudent instructor does not have poor judgment, a bad temperament, attention lapses or bad days. Employer or personal demands must not affect decisions.


### Being named in a law suit

Under most legal systems, a lawsuit can result after any incident. It’s not necessary to prove you did anything wrong for someone to file a claim against you in most legal systems. You can even be called to the court of another state or country.  
  
Anyone involved with the incident, directly or indirectly, can be named as a defendant in a suit. In most civil litigation, there is no penalty to the plaintiff, or accuser, for naming someone who actually had no involvement at all.


### Legal Systems and Negligence

#### 1 – You had a legal duty of care

As just discussed, it will need to be shown that you had a duty of care. As an instructor teaching a class or supervising divers, it’s usually not hard to show some duty of care. In other cases, however, there may not be, such as in the previous example of delivering refreshments.

#### 2 – You failed to meet that duty of care

This is called negligence. This means not providing the expected level of care, doing something questionable, failing to do something you should have done or deviating from the normal procedures and actions expected of a professional instructor.  
  
Courts do not normally give credit for “good intentions,” but instead judge you compared to what a reasonably prudent instructor would be expected to do.

#### 3 – Failure to meet the duty of care caused or contributed to the incident

Note that the failure does not have to cause the incident. Failing to meet duty of care in a way that makes the incident or its outcome worse may be considered contributory.  
  
For example, there have been successful lawsuits that alleged while the instructor didn’t cause the incident, victim rescues didn’t follow established response guidelines and practices


#### 4 – The incident resulted in damages being claimed by the plaintiff

Damages, such as injury, death or property damage, can be defined widely, but generally apply to financial losses – lost income, hospital or emergency costs, etc.  
  
Damages can be awarded in many jurisdictions if the court finds that the incident caused unreasonable pain and suffering.

### Reducing your legal risk

Use good judgement

Inform participants and students of risks

Establish and Document your proffesional conduct

Have financial protection


### Insurance

The most important benefit of insurance is coverage for costs. Professional liability insurance typically provides coverage for payment of:

- Legal defenses, which can be substantial even if the claim is eventually dismissed.  
    
- Damages awarded by the court, or negotiated in a settlement.  
    
- Where applicable, criminal liability defense.



Suppose two policies claim to provide $1 million (US) coverage.  
  

- The first costs slightly more and covers $1 million in damages per insured person involved in the incident, and pays for legal defense on top of the $1 million.  
      
    
- The other costs slightly less and covers $1 million total per incident. In other words, all those who have the policy and are being sued in the same incident have only $1 million between them to cover everything – damages and defense.

A major suit with multiple claims against multiple dive professionals can easily approach $1 million in defense costs alone. If the case is lost, the defendants may not have enough coverage to cover the awarded damages. This makes the slightly higher cost policy a far better investment.


Diver protection insurance can also help reduce and manage legal risk. These policies provide medical coverage for incidents that result in an injury while diving. Coverage varies with diver accident insurance, ranging from only DCI-related expenses, to the costs of any dive-related injury, including specialized evacuation from remote locations. Some have a death benefit for survivors.


### Regulations

As discussed, local regulations that may affect diving and teaching diving vary, and also change over time. It’s your responsibility to follow regulations that apply where you teach diving.  
  
Your Course Director, your PADI Regional Headquarters and a PADI Dive Center or Resort through which you work can help make you aware of these.


In your role as a dive instructor, when hired by someone else you are generally either an employee or an independent contractor. In most areas, this legal distinction affects how regulations, taxes and other issues apply. Both employees and independent contractors may do the same type of work, but their relationship with someone who hires them differs. With respect to type of work function, here are some ways most legal systems distinguish them.


###### Employee

- Hourly wage or salary, variety of duties  
      
    
- Regular paycheck  
      
    
- Employer controls what, and how, work is done  
      
    
- Equipment and materials provided  
      
    
- Employer has close control of work  
      
    
- May not work for anyone as desired

###### Independent Contractor

- Paid or contracted for specific role or job  
      
    
- Paid upon completion or intervals set in contract  
      
    
- Employer has limited control; contractor decides  
      
    
- Supplies own equipment and materials  
      
    
- Expected to meet contracted result  
      
    
- May work for anyone as desired

While employees are generally considered to be agents of a business, independent contractors generally are not. PADI Members, Dive Centers and Resorts are non-agents with respect to PADI Worldwide and the PADI Regional Headquarters. This is important for several reasons.  
  

- First, as a PADI Member, you agree to follow PADI Standards, but PADI Worldwide and PADI Regional Headquarters do not have the right to control when, where and for whom you teach diving.  
      
    
- Similarly, the law says PADI Regional Headquarters have no control over your day-to-day professional activities, nor any activities outside of diving.  
      
    
- PADI Regional Headquarters do not have the right to enforce local regulations that may apply where you work. You can get guidance, resources and suggestions about these as a PADI Member, but the choice to apply these is up to you.

You are free to conduct business and pursue your career in the way you think best.

As a non-agent, the law sees you as a separate entity from your PADI Regional Headquarters and the rest of the PADI organization. This may help in litigation because, when you follow standards, your PADI Regional Headquarters asserts that your conduct was appropriate from the perspective of another party vouching for you, rather than an entity trying to defend itself.


### Teaching children

The PADI organization is committed to protecting and never compromising the health, safety and welfare of children, regardless of age, culture, ability, gender, language, racial origin or religion.

The PADI organization takes child welfare very seriously, enforcing a no tolerance policy regarding issues of child endangerment or abuse. This comes first, because to do otherwise is unethical and immoral. Beyond that, professional conduct involving children is under close legal scrutiny, and the law expects such policies. It is also important in retaining public trust in the PADI family.

•

Always be public with children. Avoid situations where you or a staff member are alone with a child unobserved. Have two adults present whenever possible, and don’t invite children to your home or workplace unsupervised.

•

Provide manual support or physical contact only as needed, appropriately and openly. Be clear why the contact is being made, and never allow or engage in any form of touching that could be considered or mistaken as inappropriate.

•

Have parents take care of responsibilities in changing rooms. If groups must be in changing rooms, supervisors stay in pairs. 

•

Never do anything of a personal nature that children can do for themselves. If this is required, such as with some physical challenges, and parents can’t be available to help, have consent from the parents and child in advance, plus have another adult present.

•

Maintain open, nonsecretive environments. Mixed gender groups should have both male and female staff members supervising.

•

Do not allow or engage in rough, physical or sexually provocative games.

•

Always pay attention to, and take seriously, any reports of abuse a child makes to you. If you suspect abuse, report it to authorities.

•

Only photograph or video children with parental permission, and only use the images publically with specific permission to do so . It’s preferable to have permission in writing signed by both the child and the parents. Avoid using names and photos together in a way that would allow strangers to identify a child, except as specifically authorized by the child and parents.



# Conducting and evaluating knowledge development

## Knowledge development methods with the padi system

1

What types of learning are generally categorized as knowledge development in the PADI System?

2

In what five general ways does knowledge development occur in the PADI System?

3

By what four ways do you and your students assess knowledge development mastery?

4

What do you do if a student scores less than 100 percent on a quiz or exam and how else do you and students assess their knowledge development?

5

How do you document and track student knowledge development mastery?


The PADI System generally categorizes learning that does not involve practicing motorskills or hands-on application as knowledge development. This is a useful division for discussing instructional situations, but realize that knowledge development, assessment and reinforcement occur across all training phases, as students practice and apply what they have learned or are learning.

### Knowledge development options

#### 5 general ways

#### Independent student study
Students use eLearning, manuals and videos for knowledge development. They can usually complete all independent study before the rest of the course, or complete study sections that precede the related practical application sessions and dives. Independent study sequencing follows general knowledge development requirements.

#### Full teaching presentations
As you’ve learned, with these your presentation becomes the primary method for knowledge development. Use these when independent study media are not available.

#### Prescriptive teaching presentation
These presentations review what students studied independently to provide remediation where needed, and to apply the material to individual student needs and interests.

#### Student-instructor discussions
Students continue to learn during normal interactions in instruction. Although not formal presentations, teaching involves guiding, reinforcing, correcting and adapting as students demonstrate and apply what they’ve studied.

#### Briefings and debriefings
As you’ll see, briefings and debriefings repeat and reinforce what students have studied based on their application of it.

Knowledge development is ongoing and interactive throughout the entire training process.

1. Checking over knowledge reviews for completeness and accuracy.  
      
2. Administering and scoring quizzes and exams.  
      
3. Asking and answering questions during presentations, briefings, debriefings and other interactions with students.  
      
4. Watching students apply what they’ve learned.

Most eLearning media assist with assessment by administering and scoring knowledge reviews, quizzes and exams. There may be a paper-based, written Quick Review the student completes with you in person to verify learning and allow questions.  
  
Recall that exercises, quick quizzes and knowledge checks (including the ones you use studying here) are developmental. They allow learners to quickly assess their learning as they study.  
  
Knowledge development must usually precede the related practical application sessions or dives in which it is applied. There are some exceptions as listed in specific instructor guides, but completing knowledge development first is still preferred.


What do you do if a student scores less than 100 percent on a quiz or exam and how else do you and students assess their knowledge development?

Regardless of what knowledge development methods and assessments apply to a particular situation, you must reasonably establish that students have mastered learning objectives. As you learned in Learning, Instruction and the PADI System, in a performance-based process, students must demonstrate mastery of the objectives.

With written assessments such as knowledge reviews and exams, unless all answers are correct, you need to review missed items until students demonstrate and acknowledge understanding and mastery. For some assessments, eLearning provides this remediation.  
  
With most PADI programs, a score below 75 percent on a quiz or exam requires the student to retake the entire quiz or exam after restudying.

Most students want to learn what you’re teaching – otherwise, they wouldn’t be taking the course. They often recognize when they’ve forgotten or don’t understand something, and will simply ask for your help learning it. Usually, they only need reminders to help them recall key information.

### Documentation

PADI eLearning creates electronic records, or eRecords, that show what students have completed, as well as provide digital versions of required forms.  
  
Use Student Record Files to save signed paper Knowledge Reviews, quiz answer sheets as well as other paper documents such as releases and medical statements. Have student divers date and initial the appropriate locations on the record file as they complete course components.


### Presentation types

In the Introduction to Teaching Presentations section, you learned that how you develop and give a teaching presentation partly depends on the student media available. Recall that if there is little independent study media available in a language the student understands, your presentations provide the primary knowledge development. These are called full presentations, and deliver all the content as well as address remediation, student needs and interests, and local diving circumstances.

With independent study media, your presentations are shorter and prescriptive because the media allow students to accomplish much of the learning on their own. You give prescriptive presentations, meaning they target areas where students have difficulty and need remediation. It also means your presentations adapt the material to local diving circumstances and student needs and interests.


### Presentation components

In Introduction to Teaching Presentations, you learned that presentations have three components: introduction, body and summary (tell them what you’re going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them).  
  
Each component has elements that we’ll look at for knowledge development. Some elements apply to the entire presentation .


### Introduction parts

1. Contact

This stimulates interest, creating a readiness to learn. You can do this in many ways depending upon the students and the subject. Be creative, but what you do should relate to what you will present.

One method is to ask an interesting question, or questions, and get student responses.

Another option is to tell a short story directly or indirectly related to the subject.

Especially when students are new to a subject, you can show a relationship or analogy between something familiar and the subject.

You can raise interest by showing or sharing something that is interesting or familiar that relates to the topic in an usual way.

### Overview

This is a short “road map” that gives students an idea of what you’re going to cover. It assists learning by helping them create a mental framework so they can focus on the material instead of where you’re headed. Usually, you simply state the main topics or subjects and the order in which you’ll cover them.

### Conduct
Tell the students what you want them to do during your presentation. This is typically very brief, such as to take notes or simply listen.  
  
Conduct may already be understood based on previous sessions or the situation, but address it if in doubt.

### Value

When students know why you’re presenting the information, they’re more motivated to learn it. Your contact usually implies value, but it’s important to make it clear and be specific, as appropriate for the subject.  
  
Use value to establish the need to know – people tend to tune out what they view as unimportant, so show how the subject makes diving more fun, safer, more comfortable, etc. Establishing an immediate reason to learn motivates students to pay attention because they will expect to need what you’re teaching soon.

Make values positive, but realistic. When discussing negative subjects, don’t shy away from telling students that something can hurt or kill them if it’s true. They need to know this, but be realistic and stress how they avoid the hazard or risk by following proper procedures.  
  
For example, when explaining how important it is to never hold your breath, you might say, “This is important because failure to follow this rule can hurt or kill you, even when we go in the pool. But, it’s very easy to avoid, as you’ll learn.”

### Interaction

This means connecting with students to keep them thinking and engaged by having them do something related to what you’re teaching. You most readily do this with open-ended questions that connect with other parts of your introduction and by directing them to individuals: “Bill, why do you think this is important?” “Sungkyu, shake that soda bottle really hard and then open it.” Sungkyu smiles and refuses. “Don’t want to do that? Why not?”


### Main content

The body of your presentation is the main content, and typically – not always – includes the objectives. You’re also concerned with the scope and sequence of what you’re presenting along with its relationship to other parts of the course or subject. You also want to look at how the body material connects to the broader aspects of diving and how it relates to diving in the local environment.

#### Objectives

As you know, objectives state what students should be able to do after they complete learning. You find the objectives in the PADI materials. For knowledge development, recall that they’re commonly stated as questions students should be able to answer.

rase with “you” construction when you present (for example, “What do you do when . . .”). It’s also acceptable to rephrase statement objectives as questions that students should be able to answer after they finish learning, or to rephrase question objectives as statements so they fit more naturally in your presentation, as long as they remain measurable and they are clearly understood to be objectives by students.

The objective “What is the most important feature in my weight system?” within a presentation could be restated as, “By end of this session, you should be able to tell me what the most important feature in your weight system is.”

Objectives don’t always have to be in your presentation body. It’s common and acceptable to include objectives in the introduction, which works well with shorter presentations. But, with longer presentations, it’s usually more effective to integrate them within the body.


#### Scope of Material

Your body needs to meet the learning objectives in a logical order that students can understand. Your presentation needs to be complete without overwhelming students with more than they can effectively learn, or presenting information in a confusing way. You do, however, adapt the material to specific student needs.  
  
Follow the content and sequence within the PADI materials you reference for the presentation. This keeps your presentation within the proper scope and following an appropriate sequence.

#### Local Environment

It also helps student absorb information when it’s applied to course activities that they’ll participate in at a local dive site or as it applies to diving in the local environment.


#### Relating material

You want to apply the information about the topic in realistic, relevant ways that show the relationship of the material to what students are learning elsewhere in the same course, and how it connects to continuing education courses. You also apply it to individual needs, interests, activities and equipment along with other aspects of diving and being a diver.  
  
These connections make the information more valuable by personalizing it. And, they help establish the mental frameworks that help students recall what they’re learning.

While discussing buoyancy control during the Open Water Diver course, you say: “Being able to effortlessly stay at a constant depth is key while drift diving. Many divers who are going on our upcoming dive trip to Cozumel, Mexico, are taking both the Peak Performance Buoyancy course along with the Drift Diver course. Let me know if you want to come on that trip or sign up for one of these courses.” This connects dive travel with continuing education.

To promote environmental activities during presentations, you need to connect the topic to conservation actions, research or education. This could be a Project AWARE Dive Against Debris survey, or any other beach or underwater cleanup.


### Summary parts

Your summary assists learning through repetition that reminds students of what they’re learning and why, ideally in a way that engages them with the material. It consists of value, overview, objectives, relationship reminders and interactions.

#### Value

As in the introduction, this motivates students to remember by stating where or when they will use what they’re learning, ideally, soon. For example, “Tomorrow, at the lake we will use this to . . .” You can repeat the value from the introduction, or state another value if one applies.

#### Overview

This simply reviews what was covered and the sequence, which can be as simple as restating the main topics as you presented them. Reviewing the overview helps students remember what they’re learning by reinforcing its sequence.

#### Objectives

Restating objectives reinforces learning, but also alerts students who may still not understand something. Restate the objective summarizing what they learned if the objective lends itself to doing so.

#### Relationship Reminders

These show students how what they’re learning relates to the bigger picture: other topics, PADI continuing education, owning dive gear, dive experiences or environmental activities. These may be reminders of what you said in the body, new relationship examples or both.  
  
Promote owning equipment, PADI courses, dive travel or other services your dive operation offers as normal extensions of what they’re learning applied to the diving lifestyle. These shouldn’t come across as advertisements interrupting your presentation, but as natural examples of what you’re teaching.

#### Interactions

As with the rest of the presentation, keep students engaged by asking questions or otherwise applying what they’ve learned. This can include having students answer the objectives as questions, as mentioned, but it can also relate to the value, continuing education, equipment, dive travel and environmental activities – applied in a personal way.


### Overall handling

#### Use appropriate Padi lesson guides

This means referencing the Lesson Guides to help students mentally organize and remember, and using the Lesson Guides’ full functions by playing videos and additional information, if present. Simply having them up is helpful, but doesn’t necessarily benefit learning because it relies on students looking at them and making the connections themselves.

If there are no Lesson Guides, write the outline points based on the instructor guide outline so you can reference them on a white board or project them from a mobile device or computer. You can even project the outline itself.

#### Use PADI digital tools

This alerts students to related digital resources they have to assist learning and diving.  
  
For example, when presenting about tying knots for search and recovery diving, have students access the knots in the tools section of the PADI app on their mobile devices.  
  
When discussing dive planning, have students reference My PADI Club for diver reports on conditions and points of interest at specific dive sites.

#### Use of PADI materials or dive equipment

This means making a relevant reference that connects to the subject and benefits learning. This is often effective for connecting concepts to another course.  
  
For example, when discussing proper weighting in the Underwater Naturalist course, you could reference the weighting guidelines in the Peak Performance Buoyancy Manual.  
  
An obvious example, if you’re presenting about a particular piece of equipment, is to have it there. It’s more effective to show than to simply tell about features and operation.


#### Use of nondiving training aids

By applying creativity, you can use everyday objects to benefit students’ learning by connecting familiar concepts with what they’re learning, by creating useful physical analogies, or by allowing you to demonstrate concepts.

#### Use effective, fluid voice and gestures


Integration means to merge elements in a normal, conversational way instead of as list. This helps connect concepts and makes your presentation more natural.  
  
This is clearer when you watch an unintegrated introduction and an integrated introduction in the following examples. With both, the presenter has already used a contact to introduce the topic – interacting with aquatic life – and because this is a short presentation, he includes the objectives in the introduction and will repeat them in the body.

## Prescriptive Teaching presentations

When student divers study with manuals and videos, you evaluate student knowledge reviews and score quizzes and exams to help you assess learning. The PADI eLearning system records assessments and overall student progress. You use eLearning Quick Reviews to further verify understanding.  
  
Either way, based on what your students had difficulty with, and based on any questions they ask, you prescriptively present information to clarify topics and enhance learning. Prescriptive lesson guides simplify doing this, but you can also prepare a prescriptive presentation for courses that don’t have prescriptive lesson guides.

To determine what information to present prescriptively:

1. Note any incorrect answers on knowledge reviews, quizzes, exams or quick reviews, or anything students ask you to explain or want more information about.  
      
    
2. Determine the learning objectives to which the missed questions apply. For some questions, there may be more than one objective.  
      
    
3. Look for the prescriptive lesson guide or lesson guides that cover the objectives, or another method for best providing the information.


### Prescriptive elaboration

#### Use Lesson Guides

Prescriptive Lesson Guides are designed to help you diagnose and directly address learning gaps. The guides have explanations which are organized based on the Knowledge Reviews and quiz questions.  
  
With other lesson guides, find the guides that have the information for the objectives with which students need help. In Microsoft PowerPoint (and some other apps), you can customize lesson guides by adding photos or diagrams that apply to the local environment. Be careful to not alter the intended information, though.

#### Show equipment

The best way to explain information related to gear is to show your students, not just tell them. Equipment diagrams and pictures can help show function and variety, but interacting –touching, seeing and adjusting – with real equipment is usually more effective.

#### Provide practice and application

Often, the best way to understand a concept is to apply it. For example, students usually understand compass use much better and learn it faster by practicing with it rather than simply hearing about it. As much as possible, make practical application part of your elaboration and teaching.

#### Be creative and innovative

Creatively encourage student learning through interaction, such as by asking questions that lead to understanding.

Regardless, keep in mind that all components of the introduction, body and summary that you just learned remain.


# Confined water training

## Introduction to confined water training

- Confined water is a general term that refers to either a swimming pool or confined open water.

- Confined open water is an open water site that offers swimming-pool-like conditions with respect to clarity, calmness and depth.

Whether a pool or confined open water, to be used for training it must have water sufficiently deep and shallow enough to meet student performance requirements.

To help with this, when necessary, you may introduce skills requiring water too deep in which to stand in shallower water. Later, when you have access to confined water that meets the depth requirements, complete the confined water dive by repeating the skills in water too deep in which to stand. It should take less time since you’ve already had student divers practice the skills.  
  
Note that in tracking student progress, the skill isn’t complete until the student demonstrates mastery while meeting all aspects of the objective, including water depth


### Purpose of confined water training

The purpose of confined water training is to allow students to develop, practice and show initial mastery of those skills in an error-tolerant environment without depth, water motion or other major open water factors influencing their learning.

- Initial skill introduction in water shallow enough in which to stand reduces risk and builds comfort and confidence because students who have a problem can stand up.  
      
- Later, in water too deep in which to stand, student divers develop and refine foundational skills while mastering fundamental buoyancy control.

### Six techniques to use make confined water training more effective

1 – As much as possible, have students wear the gear they’ll wear in open water.
2 – As much as possible, practice real diving circumstances.
3 – Have students use proper open water procedures and habits.
4 – Have students practice judgment calls and problem management in realistic ways based on what they’ve studied.
5 – Have fun with it.
6 – Remind your students they can return to confined water after certification.

## Confined water planning and control

#### 1 – Depths and Conditions

#### 2 – Equipment

#### 3 – Positioning

### Site briefing

#### Facility overview
Explain where to put gear and personal items and point out restroom and shower locations and any other important details. Also cover where to find emergency equipment such as the first aid kit and emergency oxygen unit.

#### Facility Rules
Most confined water sites have basic safety guidelines and rules. Explain any rules, such as no glass in pool area, locations reserved for lifeguards, etc.

#### Where to setup 
This may be obvious, but if not, clearly explain to students where to set up their gear. For example, if there’s some distance between where you put equipment and where you will enter or exit the water, make sure students know what to do.



Do everything as if you were diving in open water.

With entry level students, you may have to explain how what they’re doing applies to open water. Expect to have to remind students to maintain buddy contact, secure cylinders when not worn, keep masks on and mouthpieces in, and use their BCDs for surface support. However, these should become routine with practice.  
  
Except emergencies that could result in injury, a good rule of thumb is to avoid doing for students what they can do for themselves.


### Control

#### Be prepared – Know what you plan to cover and the sequence in advance.

- Use PADI Cue Cards for the program you’re conducting to help you organize skills flow, but be flexible.  
      
- Start with a plan, but be ready to adapt what you do when based on logistics and student needs.

#### Communicate clearly – Let student divers know where you want them and what they should do

- Be sure everyone can hear you, which can be an issue at a crowded indoor pool.  
      
- Be specific. For example, “Wait with the divemaster by the steps in the shallow end” rather than “wait in the water.”  
    
- Establish and use hand signals consistently underwater.  
      
- When it may not be obvious, telling students what to do when they’ve finished a skill can avoid some disorganization.


#### Establish basic rules – Go over safety or courtesy rules that apply throughout a session.

- Don’t attempt or create skills you’ve not yet been taught yet.  
      
    
- Ask before getting in the water or going underwater.  
      
    
- Alert me or an assistant if you reach 50 bar/500 psi, no matter what we’re doing.

#### Use assistants or physical barriers to help keep students together.

- With entry-level divers in particular, when reasonably possible, use physical barriers to help keep students together, such as pool corners and walls, or a jetty or pier. If you don’t have a physical barrier, a visual reference, such as a float line or line on the pool bottom, helps students monitor their position.

#### Be sensitive – Think like an instructor and put yourself in your student divers’ places.

- Be alert for comfort issues, such as students being too hot, too cold, thirsty, or needing restroom breaks. Remove or otherwise handle distractions or anything that can get in the way of learning.

### Working with assistants

Communicate – Assistants help better when they know specifically what you want from them. Those who work with you regularly learn this, but starting out, be detailed. Brief them so they know your expectations regarding their responsibilities and positioning both generally, and for each session.  
  
Use their eyes and ears – Assistants may see and hear things that you don’t, such as student anxieties, skill problems during free time, etc. Students sometimes feel more comfortable discussing an issue with an assistant. Ask your assistants to privately share these with you.  
  
Make it rewarding – Assistants who enjoy working with you tend to be more effective and available. Those who feel like they’re just lugging cylinders tend not to be.


## Teaching motor skills

In Learning, Instruction and the PADI System, you learned that people best learn a motor skill by watching the skill demonstrated, practicing it, then getting feedback about how they did accompanied by corrections, refinements, reinforcement and additional practice as appropriate.

You want to show student divers a demonstration quality motor skill, which means your demonstration is slow, deliberate and emphasizes details that are important to proper execution.

When directly supervising, avoid over controlling – students best learn by having latitude to make mistakes and self-correct, with you there to keep mistakes from causing harm. Also, students learn by watching each other practice, so encourage this.

Feedback is informing students how well they performed the skill.

Remediation and additional practice after a successful performance improves the execution and helps students retain the skill. Continue practice, remediation, and repetition until students demonstrate mastery.


### Integrating Knowledge development
To integrate knowledge development with skill development, remind students when and why they would use particular skills. Connect concepts they’ve learned with skills.

You might say, “You learned that the most important rule is to never hold your breath. So when the regulator’s out of your mouth, we blow a small bubble stream . . .”

### Correcting mistakes

In confined or open water, correct and remediate mistakes and problems gently and patiently, with deliberate, calm responses.

#### Be close and ready to respond.

#### Let students correct themselves, if possible.
Note that most problems are minor and self-corrected, so generally, let your students correct themselves. Only correct problems students can’t or don’t self-correct in a reasonable time, with the important exception of immediately correcting problems that could cause injury.

#### Correct problems so that all students can learn by watching each other.

#### Highlight correct behavior.

#### Allow ample extra time to handle challenges.

Sometimes the best strategy is to work one-on-one with the student. You can do this during a scheduled separate session, as part of free time, or an assistant can guide the student with you assessing mastery when ready.

#### After correction, reinforce learning by having the student repeat the skill and show mastery.

Reinforce learning with reminders that emphasize the corrected points. Remember that students do not move on to the next confined water dive until demonstrating mastery of all skills.

### Confined water teaching techniques

As an experienced diver, you already know how to perform the skills for PADI core courses. However, in preparing to teach, you may want ideas about conducting skill training or alternative techniques.  
  
PADI’s Guide to Teaching has specific ideas and recommendations for PADI core courses and other programs. Refer to the Guide to Teaching during instructor development, as well as before teaching a program for the first time, or periodically to refresh what you learned.

If you’re teaching the PADI Rescue Diver course for the first time and want some ideas about teaching panicked diver rescue. See Rescue Exercise 2 – Panicked Diver in Rescue Diver Course Conduct and Skill Recommendations.

### Buoyancy techniques

#### Start with proper weighting and trim.
Proper weighting is important because it is difficult to master buoyancy control if over or under-weighted. Habitually over weighting sometimes leads divers to think it is acceptable.

#### Make neutral normal.
Begin immediately to have students maintain a horizontal or at least a diagonal position in confined water.

#### Keep students off their knees.
Beginners still mastering buoyancy control may need bottom contact while initially learning other skills – it reduces mental task loading by eliminating the need to think about buoyancy. Rather than kneeling (which once was a common practice), have them gently rest their fin tips on the bottom in a near-neutral state.

#### Adjust technique, not weight, if students say they’re too buoyant.
To be sure, reconfirm proper weighting. When properly weighted with the BCD fully deflated, teach students to relax, which is often the issue.


### Sequencing

You’ve learned that the PADI System builds knowledge and skills from simple to complex, but you still have flexibility to accommodate logistical needs.

Use common sense – you wouldn’t teach regulator recovery before you have taught regulator clearing. Similarly, you introduce many skills in water shallow enough in which to stand before practicing them deeper.

- Both confined and open water dives have dive flexible skills.  
      
    
- Some skills may be conducted in any dive and others may only be conducted on specific dives.  
      
    
- The emergency weight drop is unique because you can conduct it on any confined or open water dive, or both.  
      
    
- In confined water, a PADI certified assistant may evaluate skin diving skills for you.  
      
    
- It’s common to conduct multiple confined water dives together when teaching the Open Water Diver course. You don’t have to actually exit the water between each dive, but you do have to meet all skill requirements before transitioning to the next confined water dive skills, and you do have to meet dive flexible skill requirements.  
      
    
- If you combine several confined water dives in a single session, remember to cover the repetition requirements.

## Developing confined water teaching presentations

### Presentation elements

As you learned earlier, presentations have an introduction, body and summary. For water skill presentations, we call these briefing, delivery and debriefing. There are also two other elements, the demonstration and problem solving, which fit within these three divisions.

Presentation elements:
- Briefing
- Demonstration
- Problem Solving
- Control and Delivery
- Debriefing

### Briefings
Briefings include:
- Performance requirement
- Value
- Review or describe skill
- Signals
- Organization

#### Performance requirement
You need to tell students the performance requirement for the skill. This lets them know what they’re trying to learn to do in a measurable manner.

#### Value
Explain realistically why and when they need the skill.

#### Review or describe skill
If students are learning the skill for the first time, describe how to do it, walking through it dry as much as you can. However, as you’ll learn in the Open Water Training section, when having students apply a skill they’ve already mastered, you usually only need to review key reminders.

#### Signals
Show students signals you intend to use during the skill, and explain any other communication methods you might use, such as speaking or writing on wet notes or a slate.

#### Organization
Explain how you want things to go, including how the group will stay together, where assistants will be placed and how to watch the demonstrations. Create a picture of how things should look and take place.


### Demonstration

Demonstrate slowly and smoothly, emphasizing important details, to earn a score of 5 and clearly show students all aspects of the skill.

![[Pasted image 20260216073346.png]]


### Debriefings

Debriefings include:
- Skill reinforcement
- Problem identification
- Proper technique
- Performance requirement
- Value
