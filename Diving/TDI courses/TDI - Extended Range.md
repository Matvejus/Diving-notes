### Why training is important

Deco obligations increase significantly at these depths. They generally
require the use of multiple decompression cylinders. You must learn how
to rig and handle these.

You also must determine which combination of deco mixtures will allow
you to decompress in the shortest time.

Using two or more deco cylinders brings with it the risk of switching
to the wrong cylinder at the wrong depth. This can be fatal. You must
carefully follow deco procedures to avoid death.

The risks of narcosis increase significantly the deeper you go. This is why
divers generally use gas mixtures with helium at these depths. A generally
accepted limit for diving without helium is 55 m/180 ft.

You must be able to deal with any problems that arise while completing an
extensive deco obligation.

Divers using Trimix must also learn to:
Manage longer decompression obligations.
Safely use multiple deco cylinders.
Handle more substantial problems.

The decision to use helium is part of risk assessment. Technical divers should
have the knowledge, training and experience to decide whether the benefits
of using helium on any given dive offset the risks.
Another benefit of breathing gas mixtures containing helium is its low
density. This makes it easier to breathe, and may slightly reduce carbon
dioxide levels.


### Heliox
Commercial divers often use Heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen. Heliox
has two disadvantages:
Below 120 m/390 ft, divers may experience muscle spasms and tremors
caused by High Pressure Nervous Syndrome (HPNS). Research by Dr. Peter
Bennett at Duke University showed that adding a small percentage of
nitrogen to the breathing mixture prevents the onset of HPNS.

The other disadvantage of Heliox is its high cost, which makes Heliox
impractical for many technical divers.

By using gas mixtures containing both helium and nitrogen, technical divers
avoid HPNS and save money.

Boyle’s law states that the pressure and volume of a gas are inversely
related.

At a constant temperature, a volume of gas in a
flexible container will decrease in size as ambient
pressure increases on descent, and increase as the
pressure decreases on ascent.

Dalton’s law states that the total pressure of a gas mixture is equal to the
sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases that make up that
mixture.

Henry’s law states that if the partial pressure of the
gas in contact with a liquid increases, the amount of
gas that will dissolve in the liquid also increases.

### Helium

Helium is the second lightest element after hydrogen. Its light weight and low
density means your body will on-gas and off-gas helium faster than it will
nitrogen.

### Isobaric Counter Diffusion

Given sufficient differences in the partial pressures of nitrogen and helium in
your breathing mixture and body tissues, your body can on-gas one gas while
off-gassing another. We call this isobaric counter diffusion or ICD.

Ambient pressure at sea level results from the weight of the atmosphere
above you. Atmospheric pressure has a value of 1.0 bar/14.7 psi.
At a constant temperature, a volume of gas in a flexible container will
decrease in size as ambient pressure increases on descent and increase as
the pressure decreases on ascent.
The impact an individual gas has on the body is a factor of partial pressure
at depth rather than the percentage of gas in the breathing mixture.
Henry’s law states that if the partial pressure of the gas in contact with
a liquid increases, the amount of gas that will dissolve in the liquid also
increases.
We use Dalton’s law to calculate partial pressure, Maximum Operating
Depth and “Best Mix.”
You can reduce the effects of nitrogen narcosis by replacing some of the
nitrogen in your breathing mixture with helium.
Because helium is a poor insulator, inflating a dry suit with a gas mixture
containing helium wastes valuable and expensive gas.
It is possible to on-gas one gas while off-gassing another. This is isobaric
counter diffusion (ICD).


## Rescue ascent

### 1.Out of air
1. OOG
	1. provide long hose
	2. switch to necklace
	3. ask if ok
	4. extend long hose
	5. show SPG
	6. abort the dive
2. After dive aborted, he will turn off the mask
3. place his free hand on a dring
4. Check Kai's computers and your's computers
5. signal to chris to deploy smb and move to the next deco stop
6. Tap Kai's shoulder 3 times to start moving

### 2. Ascent to the first stop
1. Control buoyancy
2. Keep Kai slightly negative
3. control ascent speed - 7-8m max
4. Grab the reel 7-10m away from the stop
5. control buoyancy
6. reel the reel
7. stop 1-2 meters before the stop
8. Tap 

### 3. Switch to leaner gas
1. Put Kai's second had on my dring
2. Place his hand on the leaner gas (My right, his left)
3. While he preps and grabs the valve open your lean gas
4. When he's holding the reg in front, pull your longhouse from him and clip it back
5. Put his hand on your dring
6. Switch his computers to 50% mix
7. Switch yourself and switch computers
8. Check his comps and yours before starting ascending to the next stop
9. Ascent: Keep buoyancy and reel the reel

### 4. Deep stops - Chilling, Checking computers, Buoyancy, Reel

### 5. Stop at 12m
1. Put his right hand on the 80% rich (Your left)
2. Open your tank

### 6. Stop at 9
1. Put his arm on drop tank
2. Give SMB to Chris
3. Switch Kai's regs to 80%
4. Help him undo the 50% - keep it dangling 
5. Put his one arm on my dring
6. Switch his computers
7. Switch my regs, keep 50% dangling
8. Switch my computers
9. Open drop tank and check pressure
10. Tell the pressure to Chris
11. Chill, wait for deco to move
12. When ready to move tap on the shoulder start pushing the arm from beneath

### 7. Stop at 6-4.5
