## Decompression diving - Chapter 1


Why Do People Decompression Dive?

People choose to conduct decompression dives for a multitude of reasons,
but in general it is because they want to stay longer or dive deeper.
Motives for decompression diving may include but are not limited to:

• Spending additional time at depth
• Exploring a shipwreck, cave, or reef that lies in deep water
• Penetrating long distances into an overhead environment
• Surveying a shipwreck or cave
• Conducting scientific research
• Search and recovery
• Performing work at depth (commercial diving)

	There is always a goal or a mission, diving is just a tool to achieve the it underwater.

#### Robert Boyle
In 1667, almost two decades prior to the popularization of salvage diving,
an Irish physicist named Robert Boyle built a small low-pressure chamber
and conducted a series of experiments relating to pressure and volume.
Some of Boyle’s experiments subjected animals to reduced ambient
pressure. In one such experiment, Boyle observed a snake’s extreme
discomfort and noticed a bubble that had formed in one of the snake’s
eyes. Boyle recorded this phenomenon but at the time had no explanation
as to the bubble’s origin. This appears to be the earliest discovery of
decompression illness.
Boyle is most renowned for deriving what is now known as Boyle’s
law. Boyle’s law explains the relationship between changes in volume and
pressure and will be discussed further in chapter two.


In 1870, James Eads began construction of the Brooklyn Bridge using
caissons to build the piers. During construction, crippling symptoms
prevented many of the workers from standing up straight and the term
“bends” emerged. Although many observations were noted pertaining
to exposure time and pressure, the exact cause of the bends remained a
mystery.

[[Famous people in Diving]]
#### Paul Bert
Paul Bert studied and taught physiology in France throughout the 1860s
and 1870s. Through research and experimentation, Bert concluded that
altering ambient pressures resulted in corresponding changes to the gases
in tissues. He noticed that too much oxygen in the blood was toxic and that
too little caused oxygen deprivation.
Bert discovered two things: that decreasing ambient pressure caused
bubbles to form in tissues, which in turn caused the bends; and that
the bubbles consisted of nitrogen gas. He observed that long exposures
with rapid depressurization caused terrible side effects while minimal
exposures with slow depressurization caused little to no ill effects.
Bert was the first to recommend deep stops, specifically stopping
halfway between maximum depth and the surface. He also observed
the advantages of recompression therapy as well as the effectiveness of
breathing pure oxygen once bent. Bert was so influential that to this day
CNS oxygen toxicity is known as the “Paul Bert Effect.”

#### Haldane John Scott
In 1905, Scottish physiologist John Scott Haldane began working with the
Royal Navy’s Deep Diving Committee in an effort to decrease instances of
the bends. Through experimentation on goats, Haldane concluded that each
tissue in the body absorbs and releases gases at different rates. He introduced
the concept of “tissue compartments” and suggested unique half times for
each. Haldane also set over-pressurization limits for the tissue compartments.
Five tissue groups were identified with 5, 10, 20, 40, and 75 minute half
times.

In 1908, Haldane became the first person to
create and publish dive tables based on a
scientifically predicted decompression model.
The tables were printed in the Journal of
Hygiene. Haldane’s conclusions were adopted
worldwide and his methods set the foundation
for most modern decompression models.

#### Robert Workman
Despite the initially observed decrease in bends rates produced by the
1956 US Navy tables, they still proved inadequate for longer, deeper
decompression dives. In the 1960s, Robert Workman began revising
Haldane’s model to account for the varying over-pressurization tolerances
of each tissue and to account for the fact that tolerance levels vary with
depth. He also integrated three additional tissue compartments with 160,
200, and 240 minute half times.
One of Workman’s most significant contributions was the introduction
of “M-values.” An M-value describes the tolerable level of overpressurization
for a given tissue at any depth. He presented his M-value
calculations as an equation rather than a table, which allowed results to be
calculated for any depth.

#### Albert Bühlmann
Albert Bühlmann was an M.D. who specialized in pathophysiology of the
respiratory and circulatory system. In 1959, Hannes Keller began developing
tables for mixed-gas decompression dives. Bühlmann took an interest in
the project and began working with Keller suggesting suitable breathing
gases. With Keller and Bühlmann’s tables and mixes, Keller was able to
successfully complete Trimix dives to 120 m / 400 ft in Lake Zurich.
Shortly after, Bühlmann began working with the Shell Oil Company
and conducted a number of studies that led to the development of a
decompression model utilizing 16 tissue compartments. In 1962, Keller set a
world record by diving to 300 m / 1000 ft using Bühlmann’s new algorithm.
After a series of divers became bent diving at altitude, Bühlmann
realized the need for adjusted M-values that compensated for the reduced
surface pressure. Bühlmann developed specialized tables for altitude
diving, which were adopted by the Swiss military in 1972. In 1990,
Bühlmann published the ZHL-16 algorithm, which included considerations
for both altitude and repetitive dives, and in 1994 he published the ZHL8ADT
algorithm, which utilizes eight tissue compartments.
Albert Bühlmann died of heart failure unexpectedly in 1994. To this
day, the Bühlmann algorithms are the basis for many recreational dive
tables and computers.


## Physics Review - Chapter 2

Assuming that temperature remains constant, Boyle’s law states that the
pressure and the volume of a gas are inversely proportional. In simpler
terms, as the pressure increases, the volume decreases; and as the pressure
decreases, the volume increases.
As Boyle’s law demonstrates, when the pressure exerted on a gas
changes, the volume is altered. When gas volume decreases, the gas does
not disappear; instead, the gas has compacted, thus forcing the molecules
to move closer together. The gas still contains the same number of
molecules; it has just become denser.

![[Pasted image 20251229144539.png]]

**A scuba cylinder is a rigid object; therefore, it**
**does not compress when submerged. The gas**
**remains at a constant pressure until some of it**
**is removed through the diver’s respiration.**

When the gas is delivered to a diver through a regulator, it comes out
at ambient pressure. The ambient pressure at 40 m / 130 ft is five times
greater than it is at the surface, so the diver is breathing gas that is five
times as dense. In other words, it contains five times as many molecules

![[Pasted image 20251229144648.png]]

### Dalton's Law and Partial Pressures

Dalton’s law states that the total pressure of a gaseous mixture is equal
to the sum of the partial pressures of the gases that make up that mixture.
Dalton’s law is mathematically expressed as Ptotal = P1 + P2 + … Pn.

The total ambient pressure at sea level is one ATA. The partial pressure
of nitrogen at 1 ATA is .79 ATA and the partial pressure of oxygen is .21
ATA. These numbers may be confirmed by Dalton’s Law.

**.79 ATA + .21 ATA = 1.0 ATA**

As a diver descends, the ambient pressure increases and, according to Dalton’s
Law, so must the partial pressures. At two ATA, the total pressure has
doubled. The partial pressures of each gas must, therefore, also double. The
partial pressure of nitrogen is now 1.58 ATA and the partial pressure of
oxygen is now .42 ATA. Again, these numbers may be confirmed by Dalton’s
Law.

**1.58 ATA + .42 ATA = 2.0 ATA**

## Diving Physiology - Chapter 3

## Gas Absorption and Elimination
Gas enters the human body through the mouth and nose. It then travels
through the trachea to the bronchi and into the lungs. Inside the lungs, the
bronchi divide into smaller passages called bronchioles. Attached to the
bronchioles are millions of small air sacks called alveoli. It is within the
alveoli that gas exchange takes place.

At the surface, inert gas concentrations remain relatively stable inside
and outside of our bodies, so very little exchange takes place. A small
amount of nitrogen may diffuse in, but the same amount diffuses right back
out. Oxygen, however, is not inert. Our body utilizes oxygen (O2) and converts
it to carbon dioxide (CO2). This process causes a lower partial pressure of oxygen and a higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide within the tissues; thus oxygen is constantly diffusing in and carbon dioxide is constantly diffusing out.
Once submerged, a diver’s regulator delivers denser gas with elevated
partial pressures. The gas molecules in the breathing mixture will begin to
diffuse through the alveoli and dissolve into the blood. The blood is then
distributed throughout the body by the arteries and the dissolved gases transfer to the various tissues until saturation is reached. The rate of diffusion is controlled by Henry’s law.

[[Key concept]]
**Saturation takes place when the partial**
**pressures of the inspired gases match the partial**
**pressures of the dissolved gases in the blood**
**and tissues. The longer divers stay submerged,**
**the closer they will come to a state of saturation.**

[[Gas Laws and physiology]]
Henry’s law states that at a constant temperature, the amount of a given gas dissolved in a given
type and volume of liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of
that gas in equilibrium with that liquid.

In addition to diffusion, perfusion also controls the amount of gas that a
tissue will absorb in a given amount of time. Perfusion is the amount of
blood flow a tissue receives. Tissues that receive a higher blood flow will
on and off-gas quickly and are known as ‘fast tissues.’ Tissues that receive
a lower blood flow will on and off-gas slowly. These are known as ‘slow
tissues.’ The tissue compartment half times mentioned earlier in this book
are influenced by the rate of perfusion.

Super-saturation is thought to occur when a tissue’s gas partial
pressure exceeds that of the gases in the breathing mix. As a diver ascends,
the partial pressures of the gases in the breathing mix decrease and many
tissues may become supersaturated. The level of each tissue’s saturation
depends upon the depth and duration of the dive as well as the amount of
perfusion to the tissue.

### Mechanics of Bubble Formation
Once a gas has dissolved into solution, it remains in solution until it is
forced out by a change in pressure. Bonds between molecules create
the force that holds the solution together. Certain fluids, such as water,
have very strong molecular bonds that are difficult to break; however,
impurities or agitation can weaken these bonds.
As the pressure of gas surrounding the solution lowers, gas molecules
inside the solution want to escape. If the pressure difference is small, the
gas will diffuse out slowly. If the pressure difference is great, the gas
tension may exert enough force to break the bonds of the liquid and the
escaping gas will form bubbles.

### Gas Micronuclei
Gas micronuclei occur at points in the body called nucleation sites where
inert gas concentrations are altered due to the turbulence of flowing blood
and the movement of tissues. This weakens the bonds of the containing
fluids or tissues and plants the seed for bubble formation and growth.
While the presence of gas micronuclei increases the likelihood of
bubble formation, it is not necessary for formation to occur. Though less
likely, bubbles may form due to drastic pressure changes alone.

[[Key concept]]
**Certain areas of the body such as the elbows,**
**shoulders, and spine are more susceptible to**
**the formation of gas micronuclei. Movable**
**joints mechanically create areas of supersaturation,**
**forming gas micronuclei in nearly**
**every joint in our body.**


### M-values, Tissue Compartments, and Decompression Stops
The difference between the pressure of the inert gas dissolved in a tissue
and ambient pressure is known as the over-pressurization ratio. In the early
1960s, Robert Workman used the term “M-value” to describe the maximum
level of over-pressurization that could be tolerated without excess bubble
formation. Earlier that century, Haldane had suggested that every type of
tissue has a different rate of perfusion and a unique level of gas solubility.
He proposed that tissues with similar on and off-gassing rates be grouped
together into “tissue compartments.” Workman discovered that each
tissue compartment can withstand a different ratio and that the tolerable
amount of over-pressurization varies by depth; therefore, in most modern
decompression models, a unique set of M-values are assigned to each tissue
compartment.
If a diver wishes to exceed the no-decompression time and/or depth
limits, he will absorb more inert gas and must stop at various points
throughout the dive to allow some of the gas to escape at a controlled
speed before continuing the ascent. By conducting these stops, the diver is
attempting to control the over-pressurization ratio.

### Physiological Effects of Bubbles in the Body
The human body’s reaction to bubbles in the blood is quite similar to its
reaction to other foreign substances such as bacteria and viruses. When
bubbles come in contact with blood proteins, a change takes place that
alters their molecular structures.
These altered proteins are now antigens, or foreign bodies, and
trigger a reaction from the body’s immune system. White blood cells, or
leukocytes, are dispatched to the site and the surrounding tissues begin to
release chemicals called histamines. The release of histamines causes the
blood vessels to dilate and increases the flow of blood.
Once the white blood cells have surrounded the invader, they stick to
the walls of the blood vessel and fluids begin to leak into the surrounding
tissues resulting in inflammation. The body reacts to the fluid leakage
by dispatching platelets, which combine with collagen to form a blood
clot at the site. Serotonin is also released by the platelets and causes
vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow to the area.
The number of bubbles present in the blood and their size may affect the
speed and intensity of the body’s immune system reaction. Micro-bubbles,
or silent bubbles, may produce very little reaction, while larger bubbles that
cause decompression sickness will likely cause intense reactions.


### Silent bubbles
In the early 1950s, Albert R. Behnke used the term “silent bubbles”
to describe those that form in the body but do not cause symptoms of
decompression sickness. At the time, there was no way to directly observe
these seemingly harmless bubbles; however, based on experimentation,
Behnke was able to predict their existence.
Silent bubbles, or micro-bubbles, travel in the blood throughout the
body until they are captured in the capillaries surrounding the alveoli. The
gas from the trapped bubbles diffuses out of the blood, into the lungs, and
is expelled through exhalation.
Today, the most common method for observing bubbles in the blood is
through Doppler detection. Doppler detection uses ultrasound technology
to “listen” for bubbles as they pass through the blood vessels.

[[Key concept]]
**Over the years, Doppler testing has**
**shown that bubbles are present in most**
**divers even when following extremely**
**conservative schedules.**

### Sings and symptoms of DCS
• Confusion and unusual behavior
• Coughing up blood
• Difficulty urinating
• Dizziness or vertigo
• Fatigue
• Headache
• Joint and muscle pain
• Loss of hearing or ringing in the ears

• Rashes
• Sensitive, painful, or itching skin
• Shortness of breath
• Skin rashes
• Swelling
• Tingling, numbness and paralysis
• Unconsciousness

### Types of DCS
DCS is categorized by the severity of the “hit” and how the diver is
affected. Type I DCS is comprised of pain only hits that do not affect the
diver’s central nervous system, cardiovascular system, or pulmonary system.
Type II DCS describes any bends case that affects a diver’s necessary
biological functions. The type and severity of the hit will be determined
once the patient reaches a recompression facility and appropriate actions
will be taken to rectify the situation. Type II is the most dangerous form of
decompression sickness and is considered a medical emergency.


### Signs of AGE
• Dizziness
• Pulmonary and cardiac arrest
• Visual Disturbances
• Bloody froth from the nose and mouth
• Numbness
• Convulsions
• Chest Pains
• Paralysis
• Disorientation
• Weakness
• Unconsciousness


### CNS Toxicity
Central nervous system toxicity is generally caused by short-term
exposures to high oxygen partial pressures. A case of CNS typically
results in convulsions, unconsciousness, and possible death. Divers may
become aware of certain symptoms prior to experiencing a convulsion;
however, these warning signs may not present themselves at all or before
it’s too late.

## Understanding Modern Decompression Theories - Chapter 4

### Haldane's Decompression Model
Haldane understood that as a diver descends, his body absorbs inert gas, and as he ascends, the
inert gas escapes. Through experimentation, Haldane developed the theory
that liquids such as blood can withstand a certain level of super-saturation
without forming bubbles. He called this maximum level of super-saturation
the “critical limit.”
Haldane’s original decompression model was designed to predict the
behavior of inert gasses in five tissue compartments and was based on the
theory that maximizing the level of super-saturation without exceeding
the critical limit would achieve the greatest off-gassing efficiency. The
resulting tables encouraged divers to ascend as close to the surface
as possible without exceeding the critical limit and to stay there until
enough inert gas had escaped

### Neo-Haldanian Models
Doppler testing has proven the existence of silent bubbles even on dives
that obeyed Haldane’s critical limits. After this discovery, many scientists
were of the opinion that Haldane’s original “dissolved gas model” had
worked quite well throughout the years and that only minor tweaks
were necessary. Subsequent decompression models, such as Workman’s
tables, the US Navy tables, and Bühlmann’s ZHL-16 algorithm, followed
the general assumptions of Haldane and are categorized as “modified
Haldanian”, or “Neo-Haldanian.”

[[Famous people in Diving]]
### Deep stops
As divers began pushing deeper, staying longer, and using various mixed
gasses, the need for further model adjustments became apparent. Most of
these adjustments came in the form of deeper initial stops. One of the most
popular tweaks to the Neo-Haldanian models was introduced by Richard L. Pyle.
Pyle is a self-proclaimed “fish-nerd”, not a decompression physiologist
and as such, he based his adjustments on practical observations rather than
scientific modeling. The following excerpt from The Importance of Deep
Safety Stops: Rethinking Ascent Patterns from Decompression Dives, by
Richard L. Pyle sheds some light on the rationale behind the development
of what many divers now call “Pyle stops.”

**Pyle’s method for incorporating deep stops was as follows:**
1) Calculate a decompression profile for the dive you wish to do, using
whatever software you normally use.
2) Take the distance between the bottom portion of the dive (at the time
you begin your ascent) and the first “required” decompression stop, and
find the midpoint. You can use the ambient pressure midpoint if you want,
but for most dives in the “technical” diving range, the linear distance
midpoint will be close enough and is easier to calculate. This depth will
be your first deep safety stop, and the stop should be about 2-3 minutes in
duration.
3) Re-calculate the decompression profile by including the deep safety stop
in the profile (most software will allow for multi-level profile calculations).
4) If the distance between your first deep safety stop and your first
“required” stop is greater than 9 m / 30 ft, then add a second deep safety
stop at the midpoint between the first deep safety stop and the first required
stop.
5) Repeat as necessary until there is less than 9 m / 30 ft between your last
deep safety stop and the first required safety stop.

### Gradient Factors
Eric Baker noticed that inconsistencies in conservatism existed when these stops
were applied to certain decompression profiles. In an effort to remedy this
problem, Baker developed the idea of applying gradient factors to Bühlmann’s
M-value calculations. In Baker’s article, Clearing Up The Confusion
About “Deep Stops”, he explains the concept behind these gradient factors.
Gradient Factors provide a consistent approach to conservatism in
decompression calculations. They can be used to generate deep stops
within the decompression zone, control overpressure gradients, and
ensure a fixed margin of safety from the M-values across the entire
decompression profile. A Gradient Factor is simply a decimal fraction or
percentage of the M-value Gradient.
Generally speaking, Baker’s gradient factors control how close a diver
may come to any of Bühlmann’s allowable M-values. Gradient factors are
expressed as percentages.
A gradient factor of 100% would allow a diver to ascend until the M-value
was reached, while a gradient factor of 50% would only allow a diver to
ascend until 50% of the M-value was reached.

the fastest compartments have the greatest gas loadings during the
initial ascent and are leading. The M-values for these fast compartments
permit large overpressure gradients relative to the slower compartments.
Consequently, a large and rapid overpressure gradient is created during
the ascent to the first stop. This is out of proportion with the smaller
overpressure gradients permitted during the rest of the decompression
profile when slower compartments are controlling. Presumably, many
bubbles could be generated during the initial ascent to the first stop.

To compensate for this, Baker designed gradient factors to be used in sets
of two. 

**The first number is known as the gradient factor low or GF(Lo)**
**and is used to control the first deep stop.**

**The second number is known as**
**the gradient factor high or GF(Hi). The GF(Hi) controls the percentage of**
**M-value that any tissue is allowed to reach upon surfacing. A commonly**
**used set of gradient factors is 30/85. In this example, a stop would be**
**inserted when the diver’s fastest tissue reaches 30% of its M-value. As the**
**diver continues his ascent, the allowable gradient factor gradually moves**
**from 30% to 85%.**

**Gradient factors are typically user adjustable**
**and allow divers to “tweak” their decompression**
**according to how they feel after the dive. Divers**
**may increase the depth of their first stop by**
**decreasing the GF(Lo) and they may lengthen**
**their shallow stops by decreasing the GF(Hi).**

### VGM
For a few years, divers have used different gradient factors to
achieve this change in style, manually adjusting gradient factors
of Haldane models to suit the dive they are planning. VGM does
a similar thing, but modifies the over pressure tolerances of the
different tissues that control the various stop depths and durations.
VGM modifies these tolerances based on increased depth and
bottom time so that the diver does not have to. The equivalent
gradient factor is shown during and after each dive. This gradient
factor will change depending on the bottom depth and time for
each dive. The user can further manually adjust the factors
modifying the different tissues to achieve a decompression that
suits his or her experience and body conditions.

### Dual Phase Models
Hills thermodynamic approach attempted to predict the behavior of
both dissolved gas in solution and gas in a free state (bubbles). This new
modeling concept was the birth of what we now call Dual Phase or Bubble
Models. Unfortunately, because Hills’s approach was so radically different,
it received very little support from the community and it seemed to just
fade away until it was reawakened by future researchers.

### Bubble Behavior
To truly comprehend bubble models, you must first understand what drives
bubbles to grow and shrink. In order for a bubble to shrink, the pressure
pushing in on the bubble must be greater than the pressure pushing out.
Conversely, for a bubble to grow, the pressure pushing out must be greater
than the pressure pushing in.

**The pressure of the gas within a bubble**
**constitutes the primary outward pressing**
**force, while the pressure pressing in on a**
**bubble is a combination of three key elements.**
**The first is the ambient pressure, the second**
**is the surface tension (or Laplace pressure)**
**and the third is the pressure created by the**
**elasticity of the tissue surrounding the bubble.**

![[Pasted image 20251229163604.png]]

There are two ways in which a bubble may be forced to grow or
shrink. The first is by altering ambient pressure, and the second is by
altering the concentration of the gas inside the bubble. Altering the
ambient pressure is relatively simple and can be achieved by simply
ascending or descending. Unfortunately, we cannot hope to reduce a
bubble’s size through ambient pressure changes alone as this would require
a continual descent. Obviously we need to reach the surface at some point
and in order to do so we must reduce the pressure of the gas inside of the
bubble.

If a diver is at 5 atm of pressure (40 m / 130 ft), a stable bubble with a
Laplace pressure of .5 atm would have an internal pressure of 5.5 atm.

**Pgas in bubble = PLaplace + Pambient**
**Pgas in bubble = .5 ATA + 5 ATA**
**Pgas in bubble = 5.5 ATA**

In order for the gas to diffuse out of the bubble, the pressure of the gas
inside must exceed the partial pressure of the gas in the surrounding
tissues. Assuming the diver is breathing air and has remained at depth for
quite some time, allowing the tissue surrounding the bubble to become
saturated, the inert (nitrogen) gas pressure in the tissue will be 3.95 ATA.

**PN2 of air at the surface = .79 ATA**
**PN2 of air at a depth of 5 ATA = 3.95 ATA**

If the diver remained at this depth while breathing this mix, the bubble
would shrink because the pressure of gas inside the bubble (5.5 ATA)
would be greater than the pressure of nitrogen in the tissue (3.95 ATA).
If the diver ascends from depth too quickly, the bubble will grow due to
the decreased ambient pressure and diffusion of additional inert gas into the
bubble. Continuing on with our example, if the diver quickly ascends from
5 ATA (40 m / 130 ft) to 3 ATA (20 m / 66 ft), his tissues would not have
ample time to off-gas; therefore his inert gas tissue pressure would remain at
3.95 ATA, but the gas pressure inside the bubble would only be 3.5 ATA

**Pgas in bubble = PLaplace + Pambient**
**Pgas in bubble = .5 ATA + 3 ATA**
**Pgas in bubble = 3.5 ATA**

Since the inert gas pressure in the tissue is higher than the gas pressure in
the bubble, gas will diffuse into the bubble and cause it to grow. As the diver
continues his ascent, the problem is compounded. Eventually the inert gas
tissue pressure will fall and the bubble may begin to contract; however, there
is another factor that will affect the now larger bubble’s ability to shrink.
A bubble’s Laplace pressure is directly related to its radius. As a bubble
grows, its Laplace pressure decreases. As the Laplace pressure decreases,
the pressure of the gas inside of the bubble decreases; thus increasing its
tendency to on-gas and grow.
In the diagram below, bubbles of differing sizes are exposed to the
same ambient pressure and inert gas tissue pressure. Notice how the larger
bubble (Bubble A) on-gasses and grows while the smaller bubble (Bubble
B) off-gasses and shrinks.


![[Pasted image 20251229164346.png]]
In the above example, if a bubble whose radius gave it a Laplace
pressure of 1.5 ATA were introduced, it would remain stable because the
pressure of gas in the bubble would equal the pressure of inert gas in the
tissue. This bubble’s size would be called the “critical radius”

![[Pasted image 20251229164642.png]]
**Dual phase (bubble) models attempt to control the size of the bubbles**
**in a diver’s tissues. By keeping the bubbles below the critical radius,**
**they will continue to reduce in size as the diver ascends. To accomplish**
**this, bubble models will introduce deep stops to maintain a high ambient**
**pressure and minimize super-saturation, thus producing a higher pressure**
**of gas in the bubble. Once the bubble shrinks to an acceptable size by**
**forcing the internal gas to diffuse outward, the ascent will continue

One of the ways in which a bubble model attempts to control the quantity of
bubbles that are allowed to grow is by limiting the “initial critical radius”. As
we discussed earlier, any bubble that is kept smaller than the critical radius
will shrink, while larger bubbles will have a tendency to grow.
In the example presented by the graph above, if an initial critical radius
of four is chosen, every bubble smaller than size four would be kept below
the critical radius, thereby shrinking and collapsing. This would leave us
with only three bubbles, two of size four and one of size five. By setting
the initial critical radius at three, seven bubbles would be allowed to grow.
Each bubble model will have two initial critical radii, one for helium
and one for nitrogen, and each tissue compartment will have a unique set.
In some decompression programs, the initial critical radii may be altered
by the user through the advanced settings. Most default settings have been
empirically derived.

![[Pasted image 20251229170055.png]]



### VPM Models

**VPM is a dual phase bubble model. It utilizes**
**the Haldane and Schreiner equations to track**
**tissue on and off-gassing in 16 unique tissue**
**compartments; in addition, it works on the**
**assumption that gas micronuclei are present in**
**a diver’s blood and tissues prior to submerging**
**and attempts to limit the growth of bubbles**
**during the ascent phase of the dive.**

The VPM algorithm’s assumption that gas micronuclei are present prior
to a dive seems to contradict what was discussed earlier in this chapter
regarding bubble behavior. As you have learned, a bubble’s internal gas
pressure is a combination of the ambient pressure and its Laplace pressure;
therefore, in theory, at the surface the bubble’s internal gas pressure should
always exceed the surrounding gas tissue pressure and the bubble should
shrink and collapse.

A bubble with a Laplace pressure of .25 ATA would have an internal gas
pressure of 1.25 ATA at the surface.
**Pgas in bubble = PLaplace + Pambient**
**Pgas in bubble = .25 ATA + 1 ATA**
**Pgas in bubble = 1.25 ATA**
The bubble’s internal gas pressure of 1.25 ATA should be greater than the
tissue’s gas pressure even if it matched the ambient pressure of 1 ATA and
should therefore cause the gas inside the bubble to diffuse out, collapsing the
bubble.

So why don’t gas micronuclei collapse and disappear? The theory
adopted by the VPM algorithm is that the tiny bubbles are preserved by a
congregation of surface active molecules, or surfactants. VPM treats the
surfactant layer as if it is a boundary made from tiny balls (the tiny balls
are actually molecules). In very small bubbles, the tiny balls press tightly
against each other, forming an impermeable barrier. This impermeable
layer does not allow the force from the surface tension to affect the
internal bubble pressure; therefore, gas does not enter or leave the bubble
and it becomes stable. In larger bubbles, the tiny balls are more dispersed,
thus allowing gas transfer to take place. This variable permeability theory
is what gives the VPM model its name.

![[Pasted image 20251229170907.png]]

**The original VPM model attempted to eliminate the growth of the**
**stable tiny bubbles by never allowing the gas tissue tension to exceed the**
**internal bubble pressure during the ascent.** The original model worked
quite well for saturation diving, but proved too conservative for most sport
and technical diving applications.
The solution adopted for the subsequent revision of the VPM model
was the incorporation of the critical volume algorithm. This approach
assumes that the symptoms of DCI are generated by exceeding a critical
volume of free gas rather than solely by the size or number of bubbles
present. In order to control the volume of free gas in the body, this new
VPM model needed to track the:
1) Number of bubbles that would grow
2) Rate at which the growing bubbles expanded
3) Expansion timeframe

Over the next year, diver feedback revealed that VPM was somewhat
range limited and Erik Baker began working on an adjustment to the
model. According to Baker’s release notes, his subsequent revision reduced
the allowable gas gradients for each compartment with “Boyle’s Law
compensation subroutine”. This new model was named VPM-B, the B
standing for Boyle. V-Planner with VPM-B was released in 2003 and has
become a very popular tool for decompression divers.
In 2005, Ross Hemingway introduced and incorporated version -B/E.
According to the VPM help files:
The VPM-B/E model variation is for the extreme or extra long dives
and exposures. It gives a more relaxed version of a profile for dives when
extra safety is prudent. With bigger dives (typically more than 100 minutes
deco), the profile will diverge from the standard VPM-B, and produce a
profile similar to a combined or overlapped VPM-B and Haldane plan.
Divers who carry out the very long and deep dives, often prefer the
additional margin of safety from this combination plan concept, and the
VPM-B/E generates a plan to meet this requirement.
Due to its open source distribution, the VPM algorithm’s development
is sure to continue and it will likely remain one of the most widely used
decompression models.


## RGBM

• VPM-B bases the entire ascent profile on bubble volume, while RGBM
utilizes bubble volume to control the initial deep stops and then relies on a
more traditional dissolved gas approach to calculate shallower stops.

• RGBM reduces the allowed gradient by three factors, hence the name
“Reduced Gradient Bubble Model”. The first factor compensates for
bubbles created during earlier dives that have not completely collapsed;
the second factor adjusts for reverse profile dives; and the third factor
accounts for additional micronuclei, which may have been created during
dives conducted over several days leading up to the dive.

• RGBM accounts for the “Oxygen Window” in its computation. The term
“Oxygen Window” may be assigned several meanings; however, in this
case it is used to describe the degree of difference between the arterial
blood’s oxygen pressure and the oxygen pressure in the surrounding
tissues. Arterial blood experiences a drop in oxygen pressure due to the
fact that O2 is transferred to the tissues during perfusion and a lesser
amount of CO2 is transferred back.
Surprisingly, despite these differences, most of the profiles calculated by
decompression software running VPM-B and RGBM are similar.

**Regardless of the model chosen, no dive**
**planning tool can or should promise 100%**
**effectiveness. Every person and every dive is**
**different. Always plan dives conservatively and**
**listen to what your body is telling you.**

[[Decompression Procedures Review questions]]

## Diving Techniques and Procedures - Chapter 6

### Awareness
True awareness consists of three components: self-awareness, global
awareness, and situational awareness.

Self, global, and situational awareness are
equally important, and true awareness cannot
be obtained if any component is lacking.

### Self Awareness
Self-awareness relates to information pertaining to one’s body and
mind. Analyze the following types of information while diving to
develop self-awareness.

• Is my breathing consistent?
• Is my buoyancy under control?
• Am I demonstrating proper trim at all times?
• Is my equipment streamlined?
• Am I calm?
• Does my body feel normal?
• How much gas do I have?
• What is my turn or ascent pressure?
• What is my current depth and dive time?

### Global Awareness
Global awareness relates to information pertaining to one’s
surroundings. Analyze the following types of information while diving
to improve global awareness.

• Can I picture my location on a mental map of the wreck, reef, etc.?
• Am I disturbing the sediment?
• Can my team members see my light?
• Am I shining my light in the eyes of my teammates?
• Where am I in reference to my ascent point?
• Are any dangers present such as potential entanglements, unexpected
currents, hazardous marine life, etc?
• Are all members of my team accounted for?
• Do my team members seem relaxed and in control?

## Situational Awareness
Situational awareness relates to information pertaining to one’s future
actions. Analyze the following types of information while diving to
improve situational awareness.

• Based on my current gas consumption and depth, how far can I travel
prior to reaching my turn or ascent pressure?
• Will the current affect my travel time to the ascent point?
• How will I navigate to my ascent point?
• At what point during this dive are problems most likely to arise?
• If a problem should arise, can I ascend directly from this point or must I
travel to a different location before surfacing?
• What are my current decompression obligations and my
total time to surface?

![[Pasted image 20260102153331.png]]
![[Pasted image 20260102153354.png]]

### Stop times and run times
During the ascent phase of a decompression dive, divers are required
to conduct a series of decompression stops prior to surfacing. The
duration of each stop is referred to as the “stop time.” For example,
sport divers conduct a three minute safety stop at 5 m / 15 ft after a
dive. Their stop time in this example would be three minutes.
A run time is the amount of time that has elapsed since leaving the
surface. For example, if it takes a diver five minutes to descend to
depth and he stays there for 20 minutes, his timing device should
display 25 minutes; therefore, 25 minutes is the current run time. If it
takes the diver three minutes to ascend to his first decompression stop,
his run time will then be 28 minutes. If he must conduct a five minute
stop, his run time once the stop is completed will be 33 minutes.
When adding run times to a dive schedule, it is important to know
whether that run time indicates an arrival time or a departure time. On
a typical schedule, most run times are departure times, however after a
descent or ascent there will likely be an arrival run time inserted.
![[Pasted image 20260102153834.png]]

### Gas switches
It is important to understand that carrying multiple gases is not without
risk! Divers must carefully adhere to the maximum operating depths
(MODs) for the each of the mixes carried. For this reason, a specific
procedure for conducting gas switches has been established and is outlined
below. This procedure utilizes TDI’s MODS acronym.

**M** – Stands for MIX. The diver will identify the bottle containing the
correct mix and show it to the team. Team members will validate and
confirm that the correct mix has been selected and is appropriate for use at
the current depth.
**O** – Stands for OPEN. The diver will now open the valve of the
decompression cylinder and deploy the hose and second stage.
**D** – Stands for DEPTH. The diver will reference his depth and confirm
that he is at or above the mix’s MOD.
**S** – Stands for SWITCH. The diver can now switch second stages and
begin breathing from the decompression cylinder. If utilizing a dive
computer, the gas must now be switched on the device as well.

### Best Mix
Fg = Pg/P

**Best mix for a dive to 35m**
Fg = 1.4 / 4.5 bar (ambient pressure)
Fg = **31%**

### MOD - max operating depth
MOD = 1.4 / Mix
31%Nitrox
MOD = 1.4/0.31 = 4.5bar = 35m

### Contingency Schedules
Adhering closely to the primary dive schedule is ideal; however,
unexpected circumstances may force a change in plan. Divers must be
prepared for situations that necessitate early or late departures from depth
or those that disrupt access to decompression mixes.
To properly prepare for these occurrences, divers must carry a series
of contingency schedules. Prior to the dive, the team should examine all
applicable “what if” scenarios, identify realistic risks, and cut backup
schedules accordingly. Common contingency schedules account for:
1) A shorter bottom time (bailout schedule)
2) A longer bottom time (due to an unexpected delay)
3) A deeper maximum depth (due to unexpected circumstances)
4) A longer bottom time and a deeper maximum depth for the
worst case scenario
5) Lost decompression-gas(es)


### Calculating Surface Consumption Rates
To begin, let’s define two terms, Surface Consumption Rate (SCR) and
Respiratory Minute Volume (RMV), which are often used when calculating
gas volume requirements. A diver’s surface consumption rate is defined as
the volume of gas that is consumed through inhalation and exhalation during
one minute at the surface. Respiratory minute volume also describes the
volume of gas consumed during one minute by a diver; however, the depth
associated with the RMV is variable and must be specified.
The difference between SCR and RMV is clearly demonstrated in
following two questions and answers.

Question 1: Richard, what is your SCR?
Answer: My SCR is 12 L / 0.42 ft3 per minute.
Question 2: Richard, what is your RMV?
Answer: For which depth would you like to know my RMV?

**Example**

A diver enters the water with twin 15s filled to 200 bar. The diver
descends to 10 m. The current dive time is two minutes and the current
cylinder pressure is 200 bar; both are recorded. A moderate pace and a
consistent depth are maintained for 20 minutes. An ending time of 22
minutes and an ending pressure of 180 bar are recorded.

• 200 bar – 180 bar = 20 bar consumed.
• 20 bar x 30 L = 600 L.
• 22 minutes – 2 minutes = 20 minutes.
• 600 L / 20 minutes = 30 L per minute
• 10 m / 10 + 1 = 2 ATA.
• 30 L per minute / 2 ATA = 15 L per minute at the surface.

### Calculating bottom gas
For most decompression dives, the bottom gas will be considered that
which is used from the beginning of the descent until the beginning of the
ascent. To simplify calculations and to add a layer of conservatism, the
descent time may be treated as if it were time spent on the bottom.

To calculate bottom gas consumed:
• Add the descent time to the actual bottom time to get the
total bottom time
• Convert the maximum depth to ATA
• Multiply the total bottom time by the depth in ATA and
again by the team’s highest SCR
Bottom Gas = Total Bottom Time x Depth (in ATA) x SCR

Metric Example:
Using the table above, the descent time and bottom time combined is 45
minutes. The maximum depth is 30 m or 4 ATA. The default bottom SCR
was 19.8 L/min.
Bottom Gas = 45 minutes x 4 ATA x 19.8 L/min
Bottom Gas = 3564 L

### Calculating Ascent Gas
Even if the same gas is to be utilized throughout the entire dive, separating
the amount of gas used during the ascent is extremely important as it
is plays a critical role in calculating necessary gas reserves. The ascent
gas is broken into two parts: transitional gas, and decompression-gas.
**Transitional gas is that which is used while transitioning from the bottom,**
**between decompression stops, and to the surface.**
If multiple gases will be utilized during the dive, separate transitional gas
calculations must be performed for each gas.

• Determine the distance traveled on the gas. If a single gas is
utilized from maximum depth all the way to the surface, the
distance traveled is the same as the maximum depth. If a gas
switch will occur, subtract the switch depth from the maximum
depth at which the mix will be used.
• Calculate the travel time by dividing the distance traveled, by the
planned ascent rate.
• Establish an average depth of travel. If a single ascent gas is used,
simply divide the maximum depth by two. If multiple gasses are
used, subtract the switch depth from the maximum depth at which
the mix will be used, divide that number by two, and then add back
the switch depth.
• Multiply the travel time by the average depth (in ATA) and again
by the SCR.

**Amount of transitional gas consumed = Travel Time x Average**
**Travel Depth (in ATA) x SCR**

• In our example profile, the dive team will use a single gas to ascend
from the bottom at 30 m all the way to the surface; therefore, the distance
traveled is 30 m.
• The default ascent rate was set at 9 m/min. 30 m ÷ by 9 m/min = 3.33
minutes. To simplify the calculation and to add conservatism, round this
up to 4 minutes.
• 30 m ÷ 2 = 15 m average depth of travel. 15 m = 2.5 ATA
• The default bottom SCR was set to 19.8 L/min.
Transitional Gas = 4 min x 2.5 ATA x 19.8 L/min
Transitional Gas = 198 L

Multiple Gas Metric Example:
If in our example profile, the dive team chose to switch to oxygen at 6 m,
two separate calculations would be necessary.

Gas 1: Air
• Air will be used from the bottom at 30 m to 6 m; therefore,
the distance traveled is 24 m.
• The default ascent rate was set at 9 m/min. 24 m ÷ 9 m/min = 2.7
minutes. To simplify the calculation and to add conservatism, round
this up to 3 minutes.
• 30 m – 6 m = 24 m. 24 m ÷ 2 = 12 m. 12 m + 6 m = 18 m average
depth of travel. 18 m = 2.8 ATA
• The default bottom SCR was set to 19.8 L/min.
Transitional Gas 1 = 3 min x 2.8 ATA x 19.8 L/min
Transitional Gas 1 = 166.3 L

Gas 2: Oxygen
• Oxygen will be used from 6 m to the surface; therefore,
the distance traveled is 6 m.
• The default ascent rate was set at 9 m/min. 6 m ÷ 9 m/min = 0.7 minutes.
• To simplify the calculation and to add conservatism, round this
up to 1 minute.
• 6 m ÷ 2 = 3 m average depth of travel. 3 m = 1.3 ATA
• The default dec o SCR was set to 17 L/min.
Transitional Gas 2 = 1 min x 1.3 ATA x 17 L/min
Transitional Gas 2 = 22.1 L

### Decompression gas
Calculating the amount of gas consumed during decompression stops is
quite simple. (If multiple decompression-gasses will be utilized, perform
separate calculations for each gas.)
• For each stop, multiply the stop time by the stop depth
(in ATA) by the SCR.
• Add the amounts used during each stop together to find the total
decompression-gas consumed.

The first stop in the example profile takes place at 15 m (2.5 ATA) for 20
seconds. To simplify the calculation and to add conservatism, round up to
1 minute. The default SCR for deco was set to19.8 L/min. 1 minute x 2.5
ATA x 19.8 L/min = 49.5 L

• The second stop takes place at 12 m (2.2 ATA) for 5 minutes.
5 minutes x 2.2 ATA x 19.8 L/min =217.8 L
• The third stop takes place at 9 m, (1.9 ATA) for 7 minutes.
7 minutes x 1.9 ATA x 19.8 L/min = 263.3 L
• The fourth stop takes place at 6 m (1.6 ATA) for 12 minutes.
12 minutes x 1.6 ATA x 19.8 L/min = 380.2 L
• The final stop takes place at 3 m (1.3 ATA) for 22 minutes.
22 minutes x 1.3 ATA x 19.8 L/min = 566.3 L
• 49.5 L + 217.8 L + 263.3 L + 380.2 L + 566.3 L = 1477.1 L.

### Analyzing the Total Amount of Gas Consumed
Once the amount of bottom, transitional, and decompression-gas to be
consumed has been established, the totals may be analyzed and a decision
can be made as to whether or not the planned dive is practical based on the
volume of gas the divers can safely carry.

**Metric Example:**
Bottom Gas = 3564 L
Transitional Gas = 198 L
Decompression-gas = 1477.1 L
Total Gas Consumed = 3564 L + 198 L + 1477.1 L
Total Gas Consumed = 5239.1 L

### Calculating gas reserves

1) Begin by planning a dive to the desired depth for the desired
time using only bottom gas.
2) Calculate the amount of bottom gas needed.
3) Calculate the amount of transitional and decompression-gas consumed.
4) Multiply the transitional and decompression-gas consumed by two and
add it to the bottom gas. The sum represents the total amount of bottom gas that must be carried for the dive. Note: A diver’s breathing rate should
not vary on ascent if he properly monitors and maintains his buoyancy.
However, just as with other phases of the dive, it is possible for a diver’s
breathing rate to increase on ascent if he works harder or experiences
anxiety.
5) Ensure that the total bottom gas carried is also adequate for all
contingency schedules assuming no gas failures.

If we revisit our sample profile, the dive team needs 3564 L of bottom gas,
198 L of transitional gas, and 1477.1 L of decompression-gas.
Total ascent gas needed for one diver = 198 L + 1477.1 L or 1675.1 L
Total ascent gas needed for two divers = 1675.1 L x 2 or 3350 L
Total bottom gas needed including reserves = 3350.2 L + 3564 L or 6914.2 L

[[Question]]
The plan assumes that for travel and deco gas we will be using same gas as bottom gas - air. But in case if we are using Nitrox for deco, the time spent at deco stop will be shorter than on air, therefore the gas consumption will be less than on air. By adding transition and deco (nitrox gases) to the bottom gas, It won't give us the volume which we would spend on air.??????????

### Determining Turn pressure
To calculate minimum cylinder turn pressure:
1) Calculate the volume of ascent gas needed (decompression-gas +
transitional gas) for the diver with the highest SCR to surface utilizing
bottom gas for the entire ascent.
2) Multiply this number by two to establish the volume of ascent gas
needed for two divers.
3) Convert volume to cylinder pressure.

Metric example:
From the sample profile, the total ascent gas needed for one diver = 1675.1 L.
The total ascent gas for two divers = 1675.1 L x 2 or 3350.2 L.
The team will utilize double 15 L cylinders with a service pressure of 232 bar.
3350.2 L = 112 bar.

### OTU and CNS

One OTU is the equivalent of breathing oxygen at atmospheric
pressure for one minute. One formula to work out the pulmonary dose in
Oxygen Tolerance Units is written:
OTU= Tx (0.5/(PO2 – 0.5)) -0.833

![[Pasted image 20260102172655.png]]

Manually Tracking CNS:
1) Find the PO2 for each segment of the dive.
2) Use the chart above to find the CNS % accumulated
per minute for each segment.
3) Multiply the number of exposure minutes at each PO2 by the related
CNS % accumulated per minute.
4) Add the CNS % accumulated for each segment to find the total CNS%
accumulated for the dive.
5) If repetitive dives will be conducted, an oxygen half life of 90 minutes
is generally accepted. This means that every 90 minutes, the CNS%
accumulated will be halved.
6) Always keep the total accumulated CNS% below 100%.

![[Pasted image 20260102172808.png]]
Manually Tracking OTUs:
1) Find the PO2 for each segment of the dive.
2) Use the chart above to find the OTUs accumulated
per minute for each segment.
3) Multiply the number of exposure minutes at each PO2 by the
related OTUs accumulated per minute.
4) Add the OTUs accumulated for each segment to find the
total OTUs accumulated for the dive.
5) Oxygen half lives do not apply to OTUs. Always keep the total
accumulated OTUs below the OTU limits.

### Problem Solving Procedures
A level of risk is always present even when the dives are properly planned and executed.

**Ultimately, diver safety may only be achieved**
**through awareness, strict discipline, team work,**
**and the relentless practice of survival skills.**

### Stress Management
Fear is a naturally occurring emotion aroused by the presence of real or
imagined danger. Divers must learn to diagnose and detach perceived
hazards from actual risk. Identifying and understanding the sources of stress
will aid in this process. Fear can be a diver’s best friend, or his worst enemy.
Always analyze and react to emotions in a calm and controlled manner.

Examples of physical stress sources include:
• Temperature – either too hot or too cold
• Improperly fitted equipment
• Loss of visibility
• Injuries and illness
• Task loading
• Narcosis
• Overexertion due to current, pace, or heavy equipment
• Equipment malfunction
• Dehydration
• Incorrect breathing patterns
• Lack of skills or training

Examples of psychological stress sources include:
• Time pressure
• Pressure from others
• Threatened ego – e.g. you don’t want to be the first to call the dive
• Lack of confidence


Signs and symptoms of diver stress may include:
• Unusual behavior or emotions
• Failure to respond to signals
• Clumsy or unnatural behavior
• Wide eyes
• Heavy breathing
• Excessive attention to gauges
• Poor buoyancy
• Rapid movement
• Physical discomfort
• Emotional discomfort
• Frustration
• Muscle tension
• Loss of awareness


**The most effective method for coping with stress**
**is through relaxation and breathing control.**

### Gas Hemorrhages
Most hemorrhages can be terminated by simply closing a valve. The style
of equipment configuration chosen will dictate the procedure utilized for
isolating failures. Configurations incorporating the use of independent
cylinders call for a simple valve closure, while utilizing manifolded
cylinders requires analysis prior to problem solving.
Use the following procedure when responding to a gas hemorrhage
while utilizing independent cylinders.
• Close the valve on the cylinder from which the gas is escaping and switch
regulators if necessary.
• Signal the team.
• Call the dive and ascend, completing all required decompression
and safety stops.
Use the following procedure when responding to a gas hemorrhage while
utilizing manifolded doubles with an isolator.
• If the primary second stage free-flows, shut down the right cylinder
valve and switch to the backup second stage.
• If the backup second stage free-flows, shut down the left cylinder valve.
• If a gas hemorrhage occurs behind head, quickly place both hands over
the regulator first stages. If the problem is quickly identified, close the
corresponding valve. If immediate identification proves impossible, or if
closing the valve does not resolve the issue, shut down the isolation valve.
• If isolation is necessary due to a cylinder neck O-ring or burst disc
failure, breathe the gas from the hemorrhaging cylinder until it is depleted;
then switch to the other cylinder.
• Signal the team, call the dive, and ascend, completing all necessary
decompression stops.

### Complete Loss of Primary Gas
If a catastrophic gas loss should occur and a diver’s entire gas supply is
depleted, the out of gas diver must locate and secure a team member’s
alternate gas source. If dives have been properly planned, each diver
will carry enough gas for two divers to safely reach the surface while
completing all required decompression stops.

### Loss of Deco Gas
If a loss of one or more decompression-gases should occur, the diver has
several options:
• Switch to backup gas and run a contingency schedule
• The diver may wait until a team member has completed their
decompression and if sufficient deco gas remains, breathe from the team
member’s decompression cylinder.
• Buddy breathe deco gas with a team member (site conditions permitting)
• In the case of a regulator malfunction, feather the deco cylinder valve
while breathing from the malfunctioning regulator.

### Exceeding Planned Depth and/ or time
If unexpected circumstances cause the planned depth or time limits to
be exceeded, the dive team must revert to the appropriate contingency
schedule and complete the adjusted decompression schedule.

### Unconscious or Toxing Diver
If a member of the team loses consciousness or begins to convulse:
• Perform a risk assessment before assisting the affected diver.
• Hold the regulator in the diver’s mouth and maintain an open airway
while ascending to the surface, completing necessary decompression stops
along the way.
• Surface the unconscious diver and call for help.
• Check for breathing and pulse.
• Remove the diver’s equipment while providing rescue breaths if necessary.
• Move the diver to shore and contact emergency medical services (EMS.)
• Monitor all vitals, administer oxygen, and treat for shock, or provide
rescue breaths and CPR if necessary until EMS arrives.

### DSMB
![[Pasted image 20260102190134.png]]

### Omitted Decompression
If mandatory decompression stops are missed, it is essential that divers
take appropriate actions in an attempt to rectify the situation. If the diver
is sh owing signs of decompression illness upon surfacing, the diver
should not return to the water. Treat the victim on the surface and arrange
transportation to the nearest recompression facility. If the diver does
reenter the water, he should have another diver with him.
![[Pasted image 20260102190441.png]]

### Field Neurological Exam
The Divers Alert Network (DAN) recommends that a neurological exam
be performed as soon as possible for any suspected case of decompression
illness. In many situations, the signs and symptoms of DCI are obvious
to both the victim and the observer; however, in some cases the evidence
may be very subtle. A thorough neurological exam may lead to the early
identification of severe cases of DCI that may otherwise go unnoticed until
more severe symptoms manifest.

Mental Function
Consciousness
• Is the diver alert?
• Does he or she respond to commands?
• Does the diver respond only to pain or is he or she completely unresponsive?
Orientation
• Is the diver oriented to person, place and time?
(e.g., What is your name? Where are you? Estimate what time it is?)
Cranial Nerves
Eyes
• Can the diver move eyes in all directions?
• Is there any eye twitching (nystagmus)?
Face
• Have diver close eyes and smile; is the face symmetrical?
Hearing
• Can the diver hear equally well in both ears?
• Can the diver hear your finger and thumb rubbing together at
greater than 1 foot (0.3 meter) in a quiet place?
• Does the diver report any vertigo (spinning)?
Light touch on the face
• Is there any area where light touch cannot be felt? Record the location.
Motor function
• Get the injured diver to push against you to assess strength in as
many muscle groups as you can.
• Check shoulders, biceps, triceps and grip strength. Are these all
normal or weak, or is there no movement?
• Check flexion and extension of the hips, knees and ankles. Are these all
normal or weak, or is there no movement?
Sensory function
• Are there any areas where light touch cannot be felt on the body? Record
the locations.
• Are there any areas where a pin prick cannot be felt? Record the locations.
Coordination and balance
• Can the diver walk normally without falling over? Check this only on a
stable platform.
• Can the diver follow the movement of your index finger from his nose to
your index finger in midair?
• What happens if you move your finger and repeat?
Pain
• Does the diver have pain anywhere?
• Does the pain change with movement at the nearest joint?
• How severe is the pain? Rate it 0-10 (0=no pain; 10=worst pain ever).
Time test performed _________ a.m. / p.m.

Notes: Field neurological exams
If part of the test cannot be done, make note of any omitted
section and the reason.
• To record changes in diver’s condition, repeat the exam regularly.
• Report observations to appropriate medical personnel.
• Give priority to orientation, balance test and strength of shoulders,
arms and legs.
• Contact DAN for additional information or assistance.
Field Treatment
The initial field treatment is the same for all types of decompression illness.
• Contact emergency medical services.
• Assess immediate dangers and react appropriately.
• Monitor the diver’s airway, breathing and circulation,
perform CPR if necessary.
• Lay the victim down and keep him as comfortable as possible,
providing shade if hot and blankets if cold.
• Administer oxygen and fluids if possible until medical professionals arrive.
• The diver must be transported to the nearest recompression
facility for treatment.


### In Water Recompression
In water recompression (IWR) is an extremely risky procedure that may
endanger both the rescuers and the victim and is an absolute last resort.

**IWR should be performed only if**
**transportation to a hyperbaric facility within**
**24 hours is impossible and adequate supplies**
**and support are available.**

The first utilizes only air and requires a 7 hour 52 minute in water
treatment time; therefore, it is completely impractical for technical divers
due to the risk of hypothermia and the amount of necessary gas. The second
method is designed for use with an oxygen rebreather, but may be completed
with open circuit or surface supplied oxygen. It incorporates the use of pure
oxygen as deep as 9 m / 30 ft and exposure times in excess of three hours
which puts the diver at serious risk of developing oxygen toxicity.
Because of the dangers associated with in water recompression, the
Divers Alert Network recommends that IWR never be attempted. If more
specific information on in water recompression is desired, please refer to
page 20-12 of the US Navy Diving Manual Revision 6.


### Preparing for the dive - Chapter 9

**Creating a checklist of required items reduces**
**the risk of leaving important equipment behind.**


### Gearing up

Gearing up for a decompression dive requires patience, discipline, and
a set order of procedures. Develop a logical and efficient process for
assembling and donning equipment. Prior to entering the water, test every
piece of equipment and ensure dive readiness. The following example
presents ideas for developing a personal gearing up procedure.

• Reanalyze each gas.
• Completely assemble the diving system.
• Lay out accessory items in a manner that aids in donning efficiency.
• Turn on all gasses and leave them on. This will allow time for leaks to
become apparent. Listen for hisses associated with hemorrhages and check
all cylinder pressures.
• Run through a systematic test of all equipment as a team. This is a great
time for team members to ensure familiarity with each diver’s equipment.

1) Breathe from each second stage.
2) Inflate and deflate buoyancy devices.
3) Test each light.
4) Inspect reels for damage, worn line, or tangles.
5) Inspect fins and masks for worn or broken straps.
6) Program dive computers and check for low battery warnings.
7) Check exposure suits for wear, paying special attention to dry suit
zippers, wrist and neck seals.
• Don exposure suit. Important note: prior to donning an exposure suit, be
sure the team has finished assembling and testing their equipment, and is
ready to proceed.
• Stow all accessories.
• Ensure that the gas is still on and the pressure has remained consistent.
• Don the system, secure all buckles and clips, and properly route all hoses.
• Ensure dive readiness prior to leaving the vehicle or boat.
• Confirm the team is ready to proceed to the water. All divers should
enter the water together if possible and practical.


### START
START is an acronym intended to guide divers through the technical
diving safety checks. Each letter represents a phase in the pre-dive ritual.
Every step is equally important, and must be completed prior to every
dive.

### S - Safety Drill
The safety drill includes a bubble or leak check and a gas sharing drill.
When conditions permit, the optimal method for completing this is as
follows. Submerge to a depth of approximately two m / six feet and face
team members. Each diver (one at a time) will perform a 360 degree helicopter turn in one direction, followed by a 360 degree turn in the opposite direction. During this process, the team will examine the diver’s equipment for leaks. Primary areas of concern include but are not limited  to: first stages, second stages, valves, hoses, inflators, and buoyancy compensators. If
bubbles are not detected, signal with an okay and proceed with the drills.
If bubbles are detected: ascend, resolve the issue, and repeat the procedure.
After each team member has been examined and found to be bubblefree,
conduct the appropriate gas sharing procedure for the equipment
configuration style. Conduct this drill as though it were a real gas
emergency. Repeat the drill until each team member has acted as a donor
and a receiver. Be sure to maintain proper trim and buoyancy at all times.

### T – Team
Team stands for team equipment and readiness check. Perform a head
to toe assessment, confirming that each team member has the necessary
equipment, it is functioning properly, and it is properly stowed.
### A – Air
Establish and confirm each team member’s turn pressure. Ensure all
primary cylinder valves are on and that secondary bottles are full. Validate
all maximum operating depths.
### R – Route
Review the planned route and the dive objectives.
### T – Tables
Review the planned maximum depth, run times, and required stops.

### Debriefing
A team must conduct a thorough debriefing after completing each
decompression dive. The debriefing will encompass every aspect of the
dive from start to finish, allowing divers to identify any problems or
inefficiencies encountered.
Ideally, the debriefing will take place prior to exiting the water;
however, conditions may dictate otherwise. Immediate post-dive
discussions pull information from a diver’s mind while it is still fresh and
provide periods of rest prior to exertion after long dives.
A thorough debriefing will include discussion
pertaining to the following:
• Thoroughness of the dive briefing
• Efficiency of the gearing up process
• Pre-dive drills (START)
• A critique of the team’s trim, buoyancy, propulsion, position,
awareness, cohesion, and communication during the descent, bottom
and ascent phases of the dive
• Identification of problems encountered and analysis of the team’s reaction
• Necessary equipment modifications
• Accuracy of the dive plan
