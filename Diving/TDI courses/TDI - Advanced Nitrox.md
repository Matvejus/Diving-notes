[[Technical diving definition]]
TDI tech diving definition 
> *Any dive dive requiring a complete dive plan and sets well-defined limits*

Technical diving is mission oriented. With mission oriented approach and a technical mindset, many aspects of the dive that went unnoticed before will be obvious.

The foundation of technical mindset is that the diving is a vehicle to access smoehting distinct and special underwater. Diving becomes the means to the end, not just a matter of paying attention to the procedures of diving. This requires training that allows diving activities to become automated. In tech diving the goal should be access to some sort of target, something beyond oneself. 

Create a mental picture of an elite diver, the one that controls the dive and aware of the environment 360 degrees around them. Set the level of performance to work to. 

[[Skills]]
- Buoyancy 
- Swimming
- Trim 
- Breathing

Buoyancy - diver must make sure to have now change in buoyancy when picking up or placing equipment, meaning to think ahead.

[[Advanced Nitrox Review questions]]
1. An elite diver will have a focus on their dive that is:
	Mission oriented approach and technical approach. Diving is means to an end to access something distinct and special underwater. Focus on a dive and 360 control all the time.
2. The elite diver will focus on what fundamentals of diving?
	1. Buoyancy
	2. Swimming
	3. Trim
	4. Breathing
3. How can lung volume be used to control buoyancy?
	1. Inhale go up, exhale go down
4. While using Ideal breathing the dive should fill their lungs from the bottom and empty them from the top
5. 2 reasons to deviate from the ideal breathing:
	1. On purpose, consciously
	2. On rebreather
6. While diving, when should be hand be used for positioning and turning? - Never
7. What are the advantage of diving in working position? - streamlined, less effort, no dangling equipment that can snatch.
8. What body position should a diver be in during the working portion of a dive near an impactable environment? - flat, arched back, knees bent.
9. Is there a time in diving when the foundational skills can be ignored? - no



## Diving physics and Gas Laws

### Relevant gas laws

[[Gas Laws and physiology]]
1. Boyles law concerns itself with the relationship between pressure and volume when temperature is constant. The law describes the inverse relation between volume and pressure. During decent, the deeper you go volume gets smaller. Allows to calculate the gas pressure at any depth, the amount of gas the will be consumed at that depth and how much volume will increase if they ascend from one depth to another.
2. Dalton's law reflects the pressure of a gas in a gas mixture. Each gas in mixture will have a pressure that is directly related to its fraction in the mixture. Partial pressure of a gas is equal to its fraction of the total pressure of the gas. Allows to calculate maximum operating depth, best mix and partial pressure calculations. Also used for gas blending calculation.

## Gas physiology

### Hypoxia

[[Gas Laws and physiology]]
Too little oxygen is know as hypoxia. Breathing a mixture of gas with O2 less than 21% is breathing hypoxic mixture. Partial pressure of oxygen below .16 ATA are hazardous. Levels below 0.12 ATA can prove fatal in just a short period of time

### Oxygen toxicity
[[Gas Laws and physiology]]
If the diver breathes a partial pressure of oxygen above 0.5 ATA the diver must track oxygen exposure for each dive and for multiple dives throughout consecutive days. Oxygen toxicity falls into two areas.
1. Short-term high dose exposures affect the divers risk of having the most dramatic problem with diving mixed gasses known as Central Nervous System Toxicity, tracked as a percentage of the allowed dose for each dive and the total of each day of diving
2. Long term lower dose related problems. The diver tracks this exposure with assistance of Oxygen Tolerance Units, OTUs. These are used to track whole body/pulmonary exposures.

### CNS Oxygen Toxicity

Con = Convulsion
V = Visual Disturbances
E = Ear Ringing
N = Nausea
T = Twitching/Tingling inf the face or fingers
I = Irritability
D = Dizziness

Nausea is the most common symptom reported beyond convulsions

The exposures are a time dose concept; the higher the pressure of oxygen to which the diver is exposed, the lower the allowable exposure time available to the diver.

The most critical calculation is for CNS oxygen exposure
For open circuit the exposure is calculated for the maximum depth of each phase of the dive and then for each deco stop

if a diver is exposed to 1.4ata of oxygen on a 40 minute dive, the resulting exposure would be 40 minutes / 150 minutes x 100 = 26.7% CNS exposure.

Surface of 90 minutes will reduces the CNS exposure by 2

### Pulmonary Oxygen Exposure

Whole body or pulmonary oxygen exposure is generally related to lower dose and longer durations of oxygen exposure.

Oxygen breathed over 0.5 ATA for prolonged periods of time will begin to impact the tissue of the lungs and body. This form of oxygen toxicity is due to the irritation and reactivity of oxygen with the body's tissues, in particular in the respiratory tract. Exposure is measured in Oxygen Tolerance Units (OTU)

[[Key concept]]

/**A diver suffering from pulmonary effects of oxygen will have some difficulty breathing, pain of inhalation, dry unproductive cough, and soreness in the lungs/or throat.** 

TDI daily acceptable OTU 300

### Nitrogen Concerns

Generally accepted range of Nitrogen Narcosis is between 4.0 to 5.21

Narcosis is charachetrized by by the suppression of mental activity of the brain. Narcosis will generally amplify the existing state of mind of the diver. If the diver is nervous, that feeling will worsen. If the diver is relaxed, narcosis will make you more relaxed

[[Key concept]]

**/Oxygen is is thought to carry with it narcosis properties as well, perhaps even slightly greater than that of nitrogen. Rule of thumb is to not dive nitrox deeper than you youi would dive with air.**

### Carbon dioxide Toxicity

When we take in oxygen the body uses the oxygen for metabolic processes; when we exhale, carbon dioxide produced by our metabolism is transferred to the lungs and leaves.

If the diver is not breathing properly, is overexerting, has poorly performing equipment of is retaining CO2, the resulting effects can be dramatic.

CO2 also increases decompression risk, complicates and increases oxygen toxicity risk

### Compliment complex

[[Key concept]]
There is some evidence that part of the reason decompression illness issues are so complicated is because the body reacts to the disorder as if the body is being attacked more so than when if has sustained injury. This is in part why it is now reffered to as an illness. This creates immune cascade that can occur throughout the body, not just at the point where the bubbles have occurred. Thus, the presence of even a small number of bubbles can create an even larger whole body reaction



## Formula work - Chapter 5

### Boyle's Law

Pressure - volume relationship

[[Formula]]
P1 V1 = P2 V2

### Dalton's Law

Dalton's law is the basis for most of the nitrox calculations.

[[Formula]]
Pg = Fg x P

Pg is partial pressure of the gas. Fg is the fraction of the gas, P is total pressure. 

### Best mix
Fg = Pg/P


### Equivalent Air Depth
[[Formula]]
This calculation allows for the use of any air dive table with any mixture of nitrox.

Basically compares a dive on air to a dive on Nitrox.

(fN2 * (D + 10)/.79) - 10 = EADm

Case: We have nitrox EAN34, going to 27 meters what would be the depeth of nitrogen intake compare to a dive on air

fN2 = 100 - 34 = 66 = 0.66
D = 27

((0.66 * 37) / .79 ) - 10 = 20.9m
